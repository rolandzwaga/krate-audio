# Specification Quality Checklist: Innexus ADSR Envelope Detection & Application

**Purpose**: Validate specification completeness and quality before proceeding to planning
**Created**: 2026-03-08
**Feature**: [spec.md](../spec.md)

## Content Quality

- [x] No implementation details (languages, frameworks, APIs)
- [x] Focused on user value and business needs
- [x] Written for non-technical stakeholders
- [x] All mandatory sections completed

## Requirement Completeness

- [x] No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers remain
- [x] Requirements are testable and unambiguous
- [x] Success criteria are measurable
- [x] Success criteria are technology-agnostic (no implementation details)
- [x] All acceptance scenarios are defined
- [x] Edge cases are identified
- [x] Scope is clearly bounded
- [x] Dependencies and assumptions identified

## Feature Readiness

- [x] All functional requirements have clear acceptance criteria
- [x] User scenarios cover primary flows
- [x] Feature meets measurable outcomes defined in Success Criteria
- [x] No implementation details leak into specification

## Notes

- All items pass validation. Spec is ready for `/speckit.clarify` or `/speckit.plan`.
- The "Existing Codebase Components" section references specific file paths for planning purposes (Principle XIV compliance), which is appropriate for this section even though the rest of the spec avoids implementation details.
- SC-003 (bit-exact bypass) is a strong regression guarantee that ensures the feature defaults to zero-impact behavior.
