# Contracts

This directory would contain API contracts (OpenAPI, GraphQL schemas, etc.) for external APIs.

**For this feature**: N/A - SelfOscillatingFilter is an internal DSP processor with no external API contract. The public C++ API is documented in:
- `data-model.md` - Class definition and fields
- `quickstart.md` - Usage examples
- The header file itself: `dsp/include/krate/dsp/processors/self_oscillating_filter.h`
