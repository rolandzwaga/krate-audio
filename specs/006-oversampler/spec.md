# Feature Specification: Oversampler

**Feature Branch**: `006-oversampler`
**Created**: 2025-12-23
**Status**: Draft
**Input**: User description: "Oversampler: A reusable upsampling/downsampling primitive for anti-aliased nonlinear processing. Supports 2x and 4x oversampling with configurable anti-aliasing filter quality. Provides zero-latency and minimum-phase modes. Used before saturation, waveshaping, or any nonlinear operation to prevent aliasing artifacts. Real-time safe with pre-allocated buffers."

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### User Story 1 - Basic 2x Oversampling for Saturation (Priority: P1)

A plugin developer wants to apply saturation (tanh waveshaping) to an audio signal without introducing audible aliasing artifacts. They need to upsample the signal by 2x, apply the nonlinear function at the higher sample rate, then downsample back to the original rate.

**Why this priority**: 2x oversampling is the most common use case and provides sufficient anti-aliasing for typical saturation effects while maintaining low CPU usage. This is the foundation all other features build upon.

**Independent Test**: Can be tested by processing a high-frequency sine wave through saturation with and without oversampling, measuring aliased frequency content in the output spectrum.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** an audio buffer at 44.1kHz, **When** I upsample by 2x, apply tanh saturation, and downsample, **Then** aliasing artifacts are reduced by at least 60dB compared to non-oversampled processing
2. **Given** a prepared oversampler at 2x, **When** I process a block of samples, **Then** the output buffer size equals the input buffer size
3. **Given** a 512-sample input block, **When** I upsample, **Then** I receive a 1024-sample buffer for processing

### User Story 2 - 4x Oversampling for Heavy Distortion (Priority: P2)

A plugin developer is creating a heavy distortion effect with hard clipping that generates significant harmonic content. They need 4x oversampling to adequately suppress aliasing from the aggressive nonlinearity.

**Why this priority**: 4x is needed for more extreme nonlinear effects, but most use cases are satisfied by 2x. This extends the capability for demanding applications.

**Independent Test**: Can be tested by processing a swept sine through hard clipping, verifying alias frequencies are below -90dB.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** an audio buffer at 48kHz, **When** I upsample by 4x, **Then** the intermediate buffer operates at 192kHz effective sample rate
2. **Given** 4x oversampling with heavy distortion, **When** measuring the output spectrum, **Then** aliasing products are at least 80dB below the fundamental
3. **Given** a 256-sample input block at 4x, **When** I upsample, **Then** I receive a 1024-sample buffer for processing

### User Story 3 - Configurable Filter Quality (Priority: P3)

A plugin developer wants to balance CPU usage against anti-aliasing quality. For a subtle tape saturation, low filter quality is acceptable. For pristine mastering saturation, maximum quality is needed.

**Why this priority**: Provides flexibility for different use cases and CPU budgets. The default quality should work for most cases.

**Independent Test**: Can be tested by comparing frequency response flatness and stopband rejection across quality settings.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** filter quality set to "Economy", **When** measuring passband, **Then** response is flat within 0.5dB up to 18kHz at 44.1kHz sample rate
2. **Given** filter quality set to "Standard", **When** measuring passband, **Then** response is flat within 0.1dB up to 20kHz
3. **Given** filter quality set to "High", **When** measuring stopband, **Then** rejection exceeds 100dB above Nyquist

---

### User Story 4 - Zero-Latency Mode (Priority: P4)

A plugin developer needs oversampling for a guitar amp simulator where monitoring latency must be minimal. They accept slightly reduced filter quality in exchange for zero additional latency.

**Why this priority**: Important for live/monitoring scenarios, but most plugin uses can tolerate small latency for better quality.

**Independent Test**: Can be tested by measuring round-trip sample delay and verifying it equals zero samples.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** zero-latency mode enabled, **When** processing audio, **Then** no additional latency is introduced beyond the block size
2. **Given** zero-latency mode, **When** measuring anti-aliasing, **Then** at least 48dB stopband rejection is achieved
3. **Given** switching from ZeroLatency to LinearPhase mode, **When** processing continues, **Then** transition produces no clicks exceeding -60dB relative to signal

---

### User Story 5 - Sample Rate Changes (Priority: P5)

A plugin developer's effect is used in a DAW that changes sample rate (e.g., from 44.1kHz to 96kHz when rendering). The oversampler must reconfigure its filters appropriately without crashing or producing artifacts.

**Why this priority**: Essential for robust plugin operation, but happens infrequently during normal use.

**Independent Test**: Can be tested by calling prepare() with different sample rates and verifying filter coefficients update correctly.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** an oversampler prepared at 44.1kHz, **When** prepare() is called with 96kHz, **Then** internal filters are recalculated for the new rate
2. **Given** a sample rate change, **When** the first block is processed, **Then** output is valid (no garbage or silence)
3. **Given** high sample rates (176.4kHz, 192kHz), **When** 2x oversampling is used, **Then** internal processing handles rates up to 384kHz

---

### Edge Cases

- What happens when block size is 1 sample? (Must still function correctly)
- What happens when block size exceeds pre-allocated buffer? (Must handle gracefully or document limits)
- What happens when prepare() is never called? (Must not crash, return silence or passthrough)
- What happens with DC offset in the signal? (Filters should not introduce DC)
- What happens at very low sample rates (22.05kHz)? (Filters must still function)

## Assumptions & Existing Components *(mandatory)*

### Assumptions

- Maximum block size is 8192 samples (pre-allocated buffers sized accordingly)
- Mono and stereo are the primary use cases; higher channel counts are not required initially
- The user (plugin developer) calls prepare() before process() and after any sample rate change
- Filter coefficients can be calculated at prepare() time (not real-time critical)

### Existing Codebase Components (Principle XIV)

*GATE: Must identify before `/speckit.plan` to prevent ODR violations.*

**Relevant existing components that may be reused or extended:**

| Component | Location | Relevance |
|-----------|----------|-----------|
| Biquad | dsp/primitives/biquad.h | May be used for IIR anti-aliasing filters in zero-latency mode |
| BiquadCascade | dsp/primitives/biquad.h | Cascaded biquads for steeper filter slopes |
| OnePoleSmoother | dsp/primitives/smoother.h | Reference for denormal handling pattern |
| constexprExp | dsp/core/db_utils.h | Math utilities |
| flushDenormal | dsp/primitives/smoother.h | Denormal flushing utility |

**Initial codebase search for key terms:**

```bash
# Run these searches to identify existing implementations
grep -r "oversamp" src/
grep -r "upsamp" src/
grep -r "downsamp" src/
grep -r "resamp" src/
```

**Search Results Summary**: No existing implementations found. The Biquad primitive exists and can be reused for IIR-based anti-aliasing in zero-latency mode. For FIR filters (linear-phase mode), new implementation will be needed.
