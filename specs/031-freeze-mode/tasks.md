# Tasks: Freeze Mode

**Input**: Design documents from `/specs/031-freeze-mode/`
**Prerequisites**: plan.md (required), spec.md (required for user stories), research.md, data-model.md

**Tests**: This project follows TEST-FIRST methodology (Constitution Principle XII). Tests MUST be written before implementation.

**Organization**: Tasks are grouped by user story to enable independent implementation and testing of each story.

---

**Purpose**: Update living architecture documentation before spec completion

> **Constitution Principle XIII**: Every spec implementation MUST update ARCHITECTURE.md as a final task

### 9.1 Architecture Documentation Update

- [ ] T092 **Update ARCHITECTURE.md** with new components:
  - Add FreezeMode to Layer 4 features section
  - Add FreezeFeedbackProcessor to Layer 2 processors section (or note it's internal to FreezeMode)
  - Include: purpose, public API summary, file location, "when to use this"
  - Add usage examples

### 9.2 Final Commit

- [ ] T093 **Commit ARCHITECTURE.md updates**

**Checkpoint**: ARCHITECTURE.md reflects all new functionality

---

## Phase 10: Completion Verification (MANDATORY)

**Purpose**: Honestly verify all requirements are met before claiming completion

> **Constitution Principle XV**: Spec implementations MUST be honestly assessed.

### 10.1 Requirements Verification

- [ ] T094 **Review ALL FR-xxx requirements** from spec.md against implementation (29 FRs)
- [ ] T095 **Review ALL SC-xxx success criteria** and verify measurable targets are achieved (8 SCs)
- [ ] T096 **Search for cheating patterns** in implementation:
  - [ ] No `// placeholder` or `// TODO` comments in new code
  - [ ] No test thresholds relaxed from spec requirements
  - [ ] No features quietly removed from scope

### 10.2 Fill Compliance Table in spec.md

- [ ] T097 **Update spec.md "Implementation Verification" section** with compliance status for each requirement
- [ ] T098 **Mark overall status honestly**: COMPLETE / NOT COMPLETE / PARTIAL

### 10.3 Honest Self-Check

- [ ] T099 **All self-check questions answered "no"** (or gaps documented honestly):
  1. Did I change ANY test threshold from what the spec originally required?
  2. Are there ANY "placeholder", "stub", or "TODO" comments in new code?
  3. Did I remove ANY features from scope without telling the user?
  4. Would the spec author consider this "done"?
  5. If I were the user, would I feel cheated?

**Checkpoint**: Honest assessment complete

---

## Phase 11: Final Completion

**Purpose**: Final commit and completion claim

- [ ] T100 **Commit all spec work** to feature branch
- [ ] T101 **Verify all tests pass**
- [ ] T102 **Claim completion ONLY if all requirements are MET**

**Checkpoint**: Spec implementation honestly complete

---

## Dependencies & Execution Order

### Phase Dependencies

- **Phase 1 (Setup)**: No dependencies - start immediately
- **Phase 2 (Foundational)**: Depends on Setup - BLOCKS all user stories
- **Phases 3-7 (User Stories)**: All depend on Phase 2 completion
  - US1 (Basic Freeze) can start immediately after Phase 2
  - US2-5 can proceed independently but build on US1 concepts
- **Phase 8 (Edge Cases)**: Depends on all user stories
- **Phases 9-11 (Documentation/Verification)**: Depend on all implementation

### User Story Dependencies

| Story | Depends On | Can Parallelize With |
|-------|------------|----------------------|
| US1 (Basic Freeze) | Phase 2 only | Independent (MVP) |
| US2 (Shimmer) | US1 (uses FreezeMode API) | US3, US4, US5 after US1 |
| US3 (Decay) | US1 | US2, US4, US5 after US1 |
| US4 (Diffusion) | US1 | US2, US3, US5 after US1 |
| US5 (Filter) | US1 | US2, US3, US4 after US1 |

### Parallel Opportunities

**Within Phase 2 (Foundational)**:
```
T005, T006, T007, T008 can run in parallel (different test sections)
```

**Within Each User Story**:
```
All [P]-marked test tasks can run in parallel
```

**After US1 Completion**:
```
US2, US3, US4, US5 can all proceed in parallel (different functionality)
```

---

## Implementation Strategy

### MVP First (User Story 1 Only)

1. Complete Phase 1: Setup
2. Complete Phase 2: Foundational (FreezeFeedbackProcessor)
3. Complete Phase 3: User Story 1 (Basic Freeze)
4. **STOP and VALIDATE**: Test basic freeze independently
5. Deploy/demo if ready - this is functional freeze mode

### Incremental Delivery

| Increment | Delivers | User Value |
|-----------|----------|------------|
| MVP (US1) | Basic freeze on/off | Infinite sustain |
| +US2 | Shimmer freeze | Evolving textures |
| +US3 | Decay control | Natural fade |
| +US4 | Diffusion | Pad textures |
| +US5 | Filter | Tonal shaping |

Each increment adds value without breaking previous functionality.

## Task Summary

| Phase | Task Count | Description |
|-------|------------|-------------|
| Setup | 3 | File scaffolding |
| Foundational | 12 | FreezeFeedbackProcessor |
| US1 (Basic Freeze) | 23 | MVP - core freeze functionality (+4 remediation: FR-008, FR-024, FR-025, FR-029) |
| US2 (Shimmer) | 15 | Pitch shifting in freeze |
| US3 (Decay) | 12 | Decay control |
| US4 (Diffusion) | 12 | Diffusion in freeze |
| US5 (Filter) | 11 | Filter in feedback (+2 remediation: FR-021 bandpass, FR-022 range) |
| Edge Cases | 9 | Edge case testing |
| Documentation | 2 | ARCHITECTURE.md |
| Verification | 9 | Requirement verification |
| **Total** | **108** | |

## Notes

- [P] tasks = different files, no dependencies
- [Story] label maps task to specific user story for traceability
- **MANDATORY**: Check TESTING-GUIDE.md is in context FIRST for each phase
- **MANDATORY**: Write tests that FAIL before implementing (Principle XII)
- **MANDATORY**: Verify cross-platform IEEE 754 compliance
- **MANDATORY**: Commit work at end of each user story
- **MANDATORY**: Update ARCHITECTURE.md before spec completion (Principle XIII)
- **MANDATORY**: Complete honesty verification before claiming spec complete (Principle XV)
- FlexibleFeedbackNetwork already has freeze built-in - FreezeMode primarily composes and extends it
- FreezeFeedbackProcessor adds decay, pitch shift, and diffusion on top of FFN's freeze
