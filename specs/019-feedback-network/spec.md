# Feature Specification: FeedbackNetwork

**Feature Branch**: `019-feedback-network`
**Created**: 2025-12-25
**Status**: Draft
**Layer**: 3 (System Component)

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### User Story 1 - Basic Feedback Loop (Priority: P1)

A sound designer wants to create echoes that gradually fade out. They need to control how much of the delayed signal feeds back into the delay input, with the ability to create anything from subtle single repeats (low feedback) to long, decaying trails (high feedback).

**Why this priority**: Feedback is the core function that transforms a simple delay into a musically useful echo effect. Without this, the component has no purpose.

**Independent Test**: Process an impulse through the feedback network with 50% feedback and verify the output decays by ~6dB per repeat.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** a prepared FeedbackNetwork with 0% feedback, **When** an impulse is processed, **Then** only one delayed repeat appears in the output
2. **Given** a prepared FeedbackNetwork with 50% feedback, **When** an impulse is processed, **Then** each repeat is approximately half the amplitude of the previous
3. **Given** a prepared FeedbackNetwork with 100% feedback, **When** an impulse is processed, **Then** repeats continue indefinitely without decay (infinite sustain)

---

### User Story 2 - Self-Oscillation Mode (Priority: P1)

An experimental musician wants to create drones and texture by pushing feedback beyond 100%. At 120% feedback, the signal should grow with each repeat, eventually saturating into a sustained oscillation that doesn't clip harshly.

**Why this priority**: Self-oscillation is a signature sound of classic delay units and essential for creative sound design. It must be controlled to prevent runaway gain.

**Independent Test**: Set feedback to 120%, process an impulse, verify signal grows but is soft-limited by the saturator to prevent harsh clipping.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** feedback set to 120%, **When** an impulse is processed, **Then** the signal amplitude increases with each repeat
2. **Given** feedback at 120% with saturation enabled, **When** signal reaches saturation threshold, **Then** output is soft-clipped without harsh distortion
3. **Given** feedback at 120%, **When** processing continues for several seconds, **Then** output remains bounded (no infinite growth)

---

### User Story 3 - Filtered Feedback (Priority: P1)

A producer wants to shape the tone of their delay trails. By placing a lowpass filter in the feedback path, high frequencies decay faster than lows, creating a warm, tape-like character. Highpass creates an ethereal, thinning trail.

**Why this priority**: Filtering in the feedback path is essential for achieving classic delay sounds (tape, analog) and preventing harsh buildup of high frequencies.

**Independent Test**: Process broadband noise with LP filter in feedback path, verify high frequencies decay faster than low frequencies over multiple repeats.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** a lowpass filter at 2kHz in the feedback path with 70% feedback, **When** white noise is processed, **Then** high frequencies above 2kHz decay faster than low frequencies
2. **Given** a highpass filter at 500Hz in the feedback path, **When** white noise is processed, **Then** low frequencies below 500Hz decay faster than high frequencies
3. **Given** filter bypass enabled, **When** signal is processed, **Then** all frequencies decay at the same rate

---

### User Story 4 - Saturated Feedback (Priority: P2)

A guitarist wants to add warmth and compression to their delay trails. By enabling saturation in the feedback path, each repeat gains subtle harmonic content and soft compression, simulating tape or tube saturation.

**Why this priority**: Saturation in feedback is what gives analog delays their character. It's secondary to basic filtering but essential for authentic analog emulation.

**Independent Test**: Process a sine wave with saturation in feedback path, verify harmonics are added to delayed signal.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** saturation enabled at 50% drive in feedback path, **When** a 440Hz sine is processed, **Then** delayed output contains odd harmonics (3rd, 5th)
2. **Given** saturation enabled with 80% feedback, **When** processing for multiple repeats, **Then** signal remains dynamically compressed (no harsh peaks)
3. **Given** saturation bypassed, **When** a sine wave is processed, **Then** delayed output remains a pure sine

---

### User Story 5 - Freeze Mode (Priority: P2)

A musician wants to capture a moment and sustain it indefinitely. When freeze is engaged, the current delay buffer content loops forever (100% feedback) while new input is muted, creating a pad or drone from the captured audio.

**Why this priority**: Freeze is a creative performance feature that enables live looping and drone creation. It's a distinct mode that modifies feedback behavior.

**Independent Test**: Capture audio, engage freeze, verify buffer loops indefinitely and new input is ignored.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** audio in delay buffer, **When** freeze mode is enabled, **Then** feedback becomes 100% and input is muted
2. **Given** freeze mode active, **When** new audio is input, **Then** it does not enter the delay buffer
3. **Given** freeze mode disabled, **When** normal operation resumes, **Then** feedback returns to previous setting and input is restored

---

### User Story 6 - Stereo Cross-Feedback (Priority: P3)

A producer wants to create wide, ping-pong style delays. With cross-feedback enabled, the left channel's feedback feeds into the right channel and vice versa, creating alternating left-right echoes.

**Why this priority**: Cross-feedback is an advanced stereo feature that creates dramatic spatial effects. It builds on basic feedback but is not essential for core functionality.

**Independent Test**: Process mono impulse to left channel only, verify subsequent repeats alternate between left and right channels.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** cross-feedback at 100% with stereo input, **When** an impulse appears in left channel only, **Then** first repeat appears in right channel, second in left, etc.
2. **Given** cross-feedback at 50%, **When** processing stereo audio, **Then** each channel receives blend of its own feedback and cross-fed signal
3. **Given** cross-feedback at 0%, **When** processing stereo audio, **Then** left and right channels feedback independently (normal stereo delay)

---

### Edge Cases

- What happens when feedback is set to exactly 0%? (No feedback, single repeat only)
- What happens when feedback exceeds 120%? (Clamped to 120% maximum)
- How does freeze interact with cross-feedback? (Cross-feedback still applies within frozen loop)
- What happens if filter cutoff is set to extreme values? (Clamped to valid range per MultimodeFilter)
- What happens with NaN feedback value? (Rejected, keeps previous value)

## Shared Utility: StereoCrossBlend (Layer 0)

**IMPORTANT**: This spec creates a reusable Layer 0 utility for stereo cross-routing that will be used by multiple Layer 3 specs.

### Purpose

Stereo cross-routing (blending L→R and R→L signals) is needed by:
- **019-feedback-network**: Cross-feedback routing (this spec)
- **022-stereo-field**: Ping-pong mode (alternating L/R delays)
- **023-tap-manager**: Per-tap stereo routing

### Location

`src/dsp/core/stereo_utils.h` - Layer 0 utility functions

### API Contract

```cpp
namespace Iterum::DSP {

/// @brief Apply stereo cross-blend routing
/// @param inL Left input sample
/// @param inR Right input sample
/// @param crossAmount Cross-blend amount (0.0 = no cross, 1.0 = full swap)
/// @param outL Output: blended left sample
/// @param outR Output: blended right sample
///
/// Formula:
///   outL = inL * (1 - crossAmount) + inR * crossAmount
///   outR = inR * (1 - crossAmount) + inL * crossAmount
///
/// At crossAmount = 0.0: outL = inL, outR = inR (no cross)
/// At crossAmount = 0.5: outL = outR = (inL + inR) / 2 (mono sum)
/// At crossAmount = 1.0: outL = inR, outR = inL (full swap / ping-pong)
constexpr void stereoCrossBlend(
    float inL, float inR,
    float crossAmount,
    float& outL, float& outR
) noexcept {
    const float keep = 1.0f - crossAmount;
    outL = inL * keep + inR * crossAmount;
    outR = inR * keep + inL * crossAmount;
}

} // namespace Iterum::DSP
```

### Implementation Notes
