# Tasks: FeedbackNetwork

**Input**: Design documents from `/specs/019-feedback-network/`
**Prerequisites**: plan.md (required), spec.md (required for user stories), research.md, data-model.md, contracts/

**Tests**: This project follows TEST-FIRST methodology (Constitution Principle XII). Tests MUST be written before implementation.

**Organization**: Tasks are grouped by user story to enable independent implementation and testing of each story.

---

## ⚠️ MANDATORY: Test-First Development Workflow

**CRITICAL**: Every implementation task MUST follow this workflow. These are not guidelines - they are requirements.

### Required Steps for EVERY Task

Before starting ANY implementation task, include these as EXPLICIT todo items:

1. **Context Check**: Verify `specs/TESTING-GUIDE.md` is in context window. If not, READ IT FIRST.
2. **Write Failing Tests**: Create test file and write tests that FAIL (no implementation yet)
3. **Implement**: Write code to make tests pass
4. **Verify**: Run tests and confirm they pass
5. **Commit**: Commit the completed work

### Cross-Platform Compatibility Check (After Each User Story)

**CRITICAL for VST3 projects**: The VST3 SDK enables `-ffast-math` globally, which breaks IEEE 754 compliance. After implementing tests, verify:

1. **IEEE 754 Function Usage**: If any test file uses `std::isnan()`, `std::isfinite()`, `std::isinf()`, or NaN/infinity detection:
   - Add the file to the `-fno-fast-math` list in `tests/CMakeLists.txt`

2. **Floating-Point Precision**: Use `Approx().margin()` for comparisons, not exact equality

## Format: `[ID] [P?] [Story] Description`

- **[P]**: Can run in parallel (different files, no dependencies)
- **[Story]**: Which user story this task belongs to (e.g., US1, US2, US3)
- Include exact file paths in descriptions

---

## Phase 1: Setup (Shared Infrastructure)

**Purpose**: Project initialization - verify dependencies exist

- [x] T001 Verify DelayEngine exists in src/dsp/systems/delay_engine.h
- [x] T002 Verify MultimodeFilter exists in src/dsp/processors/multimode_filter.h
- [x] T003 Verify SaturationProcessor exists in src/dsp/processors/saturation_processor.h
- [x] T004 Verify OnePoleSmoother exists in src/dsp/primitives/smoother.h

---

## Phase 2: Foundational - stereoCrossBlend Layer 0 Utility (Blocking Prerequisites)

**Purpose**: Create reusable Layer 0 utility that MUST be complete before US6 (Cross-Feedback) can be implemented

**Note**: This utility is also required by future specs 022-stereo-field and 023-tap-manager

**⚠️ CRITICAL**: No US6 work can begin until this phase is complete

### 2.1 Pre-Implementation (MANDATORY)

- [x] T005 **Verify TESTING-GUIDE.md is in context** (ingest `specs/TESTING-GUIDE.md` if needed)

### 2.2 Tests for stereoCrossBlend (Write FIRST - Must FAIL)

> **Constitution Principle XII**: Tests MUST be written and FAIL before implementation begins

- [x] T006 [P] Create test file tests/unit/core/stereo_utils_test.cpp with test cases:
  - crossAmount=0.0 returns original L/R (no cross)
  - crossAmount=1.0 returns swapped L/R (full ping-pong)
  - crossAmount=0.5 returns mono blend ((L+R)/2 for both)
  - Energy preservation at various crossAmount values
  - constexpr evaluation test (compile-time usage)

### 2.3 Implementation for stereoCrossBlend

---

## Phase 10: Final Documentation (MANDATORY)

**Purpose**: Update living architecture documentation before spec completion

> **Constitution Principle XIII**: Every spec implementation MUST update ARCHITECTURE.md as a final task

### 10.1 Architecture Documentation Update

- [ ] T062 **Update ARCHITECTURE.md** with new components:
  - Add `stereoCrossBlend()` to Layer 0 utilities section (SC-010)
  - Add `FeedbackNetwork` to Layer 3 system components section

### 10.2 Final Commit

- [ ] T063 **Commit ARCHITECTURE.md updates**

**Checkpoint**: ARCHITECTURE.md reflects all new functionality

---

## Phase 11: Completion Verification (MANDATORY)

**Purpose**: Honestly verify all requirements are met before claiming completion

> **Constitution Principle XV**: Spec implementations MUST be honestly assessed.

### 11.1 Requirements Verification

Before claiming this spec is complete, verify EVERY requirement:

- [ ] T064 **Review ALL FR-xxx requirements** (FR-001 through FR-017) from spec.md against implementation
- [ ] T065 **Review ALL SC-xxx success criteria** (SC-001 through SC-010) and verify measurable targets are achieved
- [ ] T066 **Search for cheating patterns** in implementation:
  - [ ] No `// placeholder` or `// TODO` comments in new code
  - [ ] No test thresholds relaxed from spec requirements
  - [ ] No features quietly removed from scope

### 11.2 Fill Compliance Table in spec.md

- [ ] T067 **Update spec.md "Implementation Verification" section** with compliance status for each requirement
- [ ] T068 **Mark overall status honestly**: COMPLETE / NOT COMPLETE / PARTIAL

### 11.3 Honest Self-Check

Answer these questions. If ANY answer is "yes", you CANNOT claim completion:

1. Did I change ANY test threshold from what the spec originally required?
2. Are there ANY "placeholder", "stub", or "TODO" comments in new code?
3. Did I remove ANY features from scope without telling the user?
4. Would the spec author consider this "done"?
5. If I were the user, would I feel cheated?

- [ ] T069 **All self-check questions answered "no"** (or gaps documented honestly)

**Checkpoint**: Honest assessment complete - ready for final phase

---

## Phase 12: Final Completion

**Purpose**: Final commit and completion claim

### 12.1 Final Commit

- [ ] T070 **Commit all spec work** to feature branch
- [ ] T071 **Verify all tests pass** (run full test suite)

### 12.2 Completion Claim

- [ ] T072 **Claim completion ONLY if all requirements are MET** (or gaps explicitly approved by user)

**Checkpoint**: Spec implementation honestly complete

---

## Dependencies & Execution Order

### Phase Dependencies

- **Setup (Phase 1)**: No dependencies - verification only
- **Foundational (Phase 2)**: stereoCrossBlend - BLOCKS US6 only
- **US1 (Phase 3)**: Can start immediately after Setup - creates core FeedbackNetwork class
- **US2 (Phase 4)**: Depends on US1 - extends feedback range and adds saturation
- **US3 (Phase 5)**: Depends on US1 - adds filter to feedback path
- **US4 (Phase 6)**: Depends on US2 - adds user control over saturation
- **US5 (Phase 7)**: Depends on US1 - adds freeze mode
- **US6 (Phase 8)**: Depends on US1 AND Phase 2 (stereoCrossBlend) - adds cross-feedback
- **Polish (Phase 9)**: Depends on all user stories being complete
- **Documentation (Phase 10)**: Depends on Phase 9
- **Verification (Phase 11)**: Depends on Phase 10
- **Completion (Phase 12)**: Depends on Phase 11

### Recommended Execution Order

Since US1 creates the core class that all other stories extend:

1. **Phase 1**: Setup verification
2. **Phase 2**: stereoCrossBlend utility (can run in parallel with Phase 3)
3. **Phase 3**: US1 - Basic Feedback (creates FeedbackNetwork class) 🎯 MVP
4. **Phase 4**: US2 - Self-Oscillation (builds on US1)
5. **Phase 5**: US3 - Filtered Feedback (builds on US1)
6. **Phase 6**: US4 - Saturated Feedback (builds on US2)
7. **Phase 7**: US5 - Freeze Mode (builds on US1)
8. **Phase 8**: US6 - Cross-Feedback (builds on US1 + Phase 2)
9. **Phase 9-12**: Polish and completion

### Within Each User Story

- **TESTING-GUIDE check**: FIRST task - verify testing guide is in context
- **Tests FIRST**: Tests MUST be written and FAIL before implementation (Principle XII)
- **Implementation**: Make tests pass
- **Verification**: Confirm tests pass
- **Commit**: LAST task - commit completed work

### Parallel Opportunities

- **Phase 2 + Phase 3**: stereoCrossBlend and US1 can run in parallel (different files)
- **US3 + US5**: Filtered Feedback and Freeze Mode are independent after US1 completes
- **Within each story**: Tasks marked [P] can run in parallel

---

## Implementation Strategy

### MVP First (User Story 1 Only)

1. Complete Phase 1: Setup (verification)
2. Complete Phase 3: User Story 1 - Basic Feedback Loop
3. **STOP and VALIDATE**: Test US1 independently with 0%, 50%, 100% feedback
4. This gives a functional FeedbackNetwork with basic echo capability

### Incremental Delivery

1. US1 → Core feedback loop (MVP)
2. US2 → Extended range with self-oscillation protection
3. US3 → Tone shaping with filter
4. US4 → Character with saturation control
5. US5 → Creative freeze mode
6. US6 → Spatial ping-pong effects

Each story adds value and can be tested independently.
