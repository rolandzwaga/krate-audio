# Tasks: Stochastic Shaper

**Input**: Design documents from `/specs/106-stochastic-shaper/`
**Prerequisites**: plan.md (complete), spec.md (complete), research.md (complete), data-model.md (complete), contracts/stochastic_shaper.h (complete)

**Tests**: This project follows TEST-FIRST methodology (Constitution Principle XII). Tests MUST be written before implementation.

**Organization**: Tasks are grouped by user story to enable independent implementation and testing of each story.

---

## ⚠️ MANDATORY: Test-First Development Workflow

**CRITICAL**: Every implementation task MUST follow this workflow. These are not guidelines - they are requirements.

### Required Steps for EVERY Task

Before starting ANY implementation task, include these as EXPLICIT todo items:

1. **Write Failing Tests**: Create test file and write tests that FAIL (no implementation yet)
2. **Implement**: Write code to make tests pass
3. **Verify**: Run tests and confirm they pass
4. **Commit**: Commit the completed work

Skills auto-load when needed (testing-guide, vst-guide) - no manual context verification required.

### Cross-Platform Compatibility Check (After Each User Story)

**CRITICAL for VST3 projects**: The VST3 SDK enables `-ffast-math` globally, which breaks IEEE 754 compliance. After implementing tests, verify:

1. **IEEE 754 Function Usage**: If any test file uses `std::isnan()`, `std::isfinite()`, `std::isinf()`, or NaN/infinity detection:
   - Add the file to the `-fno-fast-math` list in `dsp/tests/CMakeLists.txt`
   - Pattern to add:
     ```cmake
     if(CMAKE_CXX_COMPILER_ID MATCHES "Clang|GNU")
         set_source_files_properties(
             unit/primitives/stochastic_shaper_test.cpp  # ADD YOUR FILE HERE
             PROPERTIES COMPILE_FLAGS "-fno-fast-math -fno-finite-math-only"
         )
     endif()
     ```

2. **Floating-Point Precision**: Use `Approx().margin()` for comparisons, not exact equality

3. **Approval Tests**: Use `std::setprecision(6)` or less (MSVC/Clang differ at 7th-8th digits)

This check prevents CI failures on macOS/Linux that pass locally on Windows.

## Format: `[ID] [P?] [Story] Description`

- **[P]**: Can run in parallel (different files, no dependencies)
- **[Story]**: Which user story this task belongs to (e.g., US1, US2, US3, US4)
- Include exact file paths in descriptions

---

## Phase 1: Setup (Shared Infrastructure)

**Purpose**: Project initialization and header scaffolding

No setup tasks needed - project structure already established, header contract exists at `specs/106-stochastic-shaper/contracts/stochastic_shaper.h`

---

## Phase 2: Foundational (Blocking Prerequisites)

**Purpose**: Core header implementation that ALL user stories depend on

**⚠️ CRITICAL**: No user story work can begin until this phase is complete

- [X] T001 Create `dsp/include/krate/dsp/primitives/stochastic_shaper.h` from header contract at `specs/106-stochastic-shaper/contracts/stochastic_shaper.h`
- [X] T002 Add `#include <krate/dsp/primitives/stochastic_shaper.h>` to `dsp/include/krate/dsp/primitives.h` for umbrella inclusion (N/A - no umbrella header exists in this project)

**Checkpoint**: Foundation ready - user story implementation can now begin

---

## Phase 3: User Story 1 - Basic Analog Warmth (Priority: P1) 🎯 MVP

**Goal**: Implement core stochastic waveshaping that adds organic imperfection to digital distortion. Output must vary over time even with constant input, distinguishing it from static waveshaping.

**Independent Test**: Process a constant-amplitude sine wave and verify output varies over time with jitterAmount > 0, showing time-varying spectral characteristics that distinguish it from static waveshaping.

---

## Phase 4: User Story 2 - Jitter Rate Control (Priority: P2)

**Goal**: Implement jitter rate control to determine how fast randomness changes - slow jitter (sub-Hz) for subtle drift vs fast jitter (audio rate) for gritty textures. Rate parameter determines the character from slow "component drift" to rapid "noise injection."

**Independent Test**: Compare output at jitterRate=0.1Hz (slow) vs jitterRate=100Hz (fast) - slow setting shows gradual spectral evolution while fast setting shows rapid variations.

### 4.5 Commit (MANDATORY)

---

## Phase 5: User Story 3 - Coefficient Noise (Priority: P2)

**Goal**: Implement coefficient noise to randomize the shape of the curve itself, not just signal offset. Simulates how analog component values vary (resistors, capacitors affecting saturation knee). Modulates drive amount moment-to-moment.

**Independent Test**: Process a ramp signal and observe that transfer function shape varies over time with coefficientNoise > 0, not just DC offset.

**Requirements Covered**: FR-015 to FR-018, FR-023, FR-034, SC-006

> **Constitution Principle XIII**: Every spec implementation MUST update architecture documentation as a final task

### 10.1 Architecture Documentation Update

- [X] T110 Update `specs/_architecture_/layer-1-primitives.md` with StochasticShaper entry:

## Phase 11: Completion Verification (MANDATORY)

**Purpose**: Honestly verify all requirements are met before claiming completion

> **Constitution Principle XV**: Spec implementations MUST be honestly assessed. Claiming "done" when requirements are not met is a violation of trust.

### 11.1 Requirements Verification

Before claiming this spec is complete, verify EVERY requirement:

- [X] T114 Review ALL SC-001 to SC-008 success criteria and verify measurable targets are achieved
- [X] T115 Search for cheating patterns in implementation:
  - [X] No `// placeholder` or `// TODO` comments in `dsp/include/krate/dsp/primitives/stochastic_shaper.h`
  - [X] No test thresholds relaxed from spec requirements in `dsp/tests/unit/primitives/stochastic_shaper_test.cpp`
  - [X] No features quietly removed from scope

### 11.2 Fill Compliance Table in spec.md

- [X] T116 Update `specs/106-stochastic-shaper/spec.md` "Implementation Verification" section with compliance status for each FR-xxx and SC-xxx requirement
- [X] T117 Mark overall status honestly in spec.md: COMPLETE / NOT COMPLETE / PARTIAL

### 11.3 Honest Self-Check

Answer these questions. If ANY answer is "yes", you CANNOT claim completion:

1. Did I change ANY test threshold from what the spec originally required? NO
2. Are there ANY "placeholder", "stub", or "TODO" comments in new code? NO
3. Did I remove ANY features from scope without telling the user? NO
4. Would the spec author consider this "done"? YES
5. If I were the user, would I feel cheated? NO

- [X] T118 All self-check questions answered "no" (or gaps documented honestly in spec.md)

**Checkpoint**: Honest assessment complete - ready for final phase

---

## Notes

- [P] tasks = different test cases or independent implementation details, no dependencies
- [Story] label maps task to specific user story for traceability
- Each user story should be independently completable and testable
- Skills auto-load when needed (testing-guide, dsp-architecture)
- **MANDATORY**: Write tests that FAIL before implementing (Principle XII)
- **MANDATORY**: Verify cross-platform IEEE 754 compliance (add test file to `-fno-fast-math` list)
- **MANDATORY**: Build and fix warnings after each user story
- **MANDATORY**: Commit work at end of each user story
- **MANDATORY**: Update `specs/_architecture_/layer-1-primitives.md` before spec completion (Principle XIII)
- **MANDATORY**: Complete honesty verification before claiming spec complete (Principle XV)
- **MANDATORY**: Fill Implementation Verification table in spec.md with honest assessment
- Stop at any checkpoint to validate story independently
- **NEVER claim completion if ANY requirement is not met** - document gaps honestly instead
- All file paths are absolute from repository root: `dsp/include/krate/dsp/primitives/`, `dsp/tests/unit/primitives/`
