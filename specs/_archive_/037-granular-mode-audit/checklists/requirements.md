# Spec Quality Checklist: Granular Mode Audit

**Spec**: `specs/037-granular-mode-audit/spec.md`
**Date**: 2025-12-30
**Status**: PASSED

## Specification Quality Criteria

### 1. User Scenarios
- [x] At least 2 user stories defined
- [x] Each story has clear priority (P1, P2, etc.)
- [x] Acceptance scenarios use Given/When/Then format
- [x] Edge cases identified and documented

### 2. Requirements
- [x] All functional requirements have FR-xxx identifiers
- [x] Requirements are testable and verifiable
- [x] Key entities are documented with layer assignments

### 3. Success Criteria
- [x] All success criteria have SC-xxx identifiers
- [x] Criteria are measurable (not vague)
- [x] Thresholds are specific (e.g., "1,500 lines" not "comprehensive")

### 4. Existing Components
- [x] Relevant existing components identified
- [x] Component locations documented
- [x] Layer assignments included (Principle XIV compliance)

### 5. Implementation Verification
- [x] Compliance table maps each requirement to status
- [x] Evidence provided for each MET requirement
- [x] Honest assessment section included
- [x] No cheating patterns (relaxed thresholds, placeholders, etc.)

## Audit-Specific Quality Criteria

### 6. Signal Path Analysis
- [x] Complete signal flow documented
- [x] Each processing stage identified
- [x] Layer hierarchy respected in flow

### 7. Industry Comparison
- [x] External sources consulted (web research)
- [x] Comparison table with specific aspects
- [x] Each aspect has clear status (CORRECT/INCORRECT)

### 8. Test Coverage Analysis
- [x] All component test files identified
- [x] Line counts documented
- [x] Coverage areas listed per component
- [x] Integration test coverage verified
