# Tasks: Spectral Delay

**Input**: Design documents from `/specs/033-spectral-delay/`
**Prerequisites**: plan.md (required), spec.md (required for user stories), research.md, data-model.md, quickstart.md

**Tests**: This project follows TEST-FIRST methodology (Constitution Principle XII). Tests MUST be written before implementation.

**Organization**: Tasks are grouped by user story to enable independent implementation and testing of each story.

---

## Format: `[ID] [P?] [Story] Description`

- **[P]**: Can run in parallel (different files, no dependencies)
- **[Story]**: Which user story this task belongs to (e.g., US1, US2, US3)
- Include exact file paths in descriptions

---

## Phase 1: Setup (Shared Infrastructure)

**Purpose**: Project initialization and basic structure

- [x] T001 Verify TESTING-GUIDE.md is in context (ingest `specs/TESTING-GUIDE.md` if needed)
- [x] T002 Add spectral_delay_test.cpp to tests/CMakeLists.txt
- [x] T003 Create empty SpectralDelay class skeleton in src/dsp/features/spectral_delay.h

---

## Phase 2: Foundational (Blocking Prerequisites)

**Purpose**: Core SpectralDelay class structure that MUST be complete before ANY user story

**CRITICAL**: No user story work can begin until this phase is complete

- [x] T004 Write foundational tests in tests/unit/features/spectral_delay_test.cpp:
  - Default construction
  - prepare() at various sample rates (44.1/48/96/192 kHz)
  - reset() clears state
  - isPrepared() returns correct state
  - setFFTSize() for 512/1024/2048/4096
  - getLatencySamples() returns FFT size
- [x] T005 Implement SpreadDirection enum in src/dsp/features/spectral_delay.h
- [x] T006 Implement SpectralDelay class skeleton with:
  - Constants (kMinFFTSize, kMaxFFTSize, kDefaultFFTSize, kMinDelayMs, kMaxDelayMs, etc.)
  - Member variables (STFT L/R, OverlapAdd L/R, SpectralBuffer instances, DelayLine vectors)
  - prepare()/reset()/isPrepared() lifecycle
  - setFFTSize()/getFFTSize()
  - getLatencySamples()
- [x] T007 Verify foundational tests pass
- [x] T008 Add spectral_delay_test.cpp to -fno-fast-math list in tests/CMakeLists.txt
- [x] T009 Commit foundational SpectralDelay structure

**Checkpoint**: Foundation ready - user story implementation can now begin

- [ ] T079 **Review ALL SC-xxx success criteria** (SC-001 to SC-008) and verify measurable targets
- [ ] T080 **Search for cheating patterns** in implementation:
  - [ ] No `// placeholder` or `// TODO` comments in new code
  - [ ] No test thresholds relaxed from spec requirements
  - [ ] No features quietly removed from scope

### 10.2 Fill Compliance Table in spec.md

- [ ] T081 **Update spec.md "Implementation Verification" section** with compliance status for each FR and SC
- [ ] T082 **Mark overall status honestly**: COMPLETE / NOT COMPLETE / PARTIAL

### 10.3 Honest Self-Check

- [ ] T083 **All self-check questions answered "no"** (or gaps documented honestly):
  1. Did I change ANY test threshold from spec requirements?
  2. Are there ANY "placeholder"/"TODO" comments in new code?
  3. Did I remove ANY features from scope without user approval?
  4. Would the spec author consider this "done"?
  5. If I were the user, would I feel cheated?

**Checkpoint**: Honest assessment complete

---

## Phase 11: Final Completion

**Purpose**: Final commit and completion claim

- [ ] T084 **Commit all spec work** to feature branch
- [ ] T085 **Verify all tests pass** (run full test suite)
- [ ] T086 **Claim completion ONLY if all requirements are MET**

**Checkpoint**: Spec implementation honestly complete

---

## Dependencies & Execution Order

### Phase Dependencies

- **Setup (Phase 1)**: No dependencies - start immediately
- **Foundational (Phase 2)**: Depends on Setup - BLOCKS all user stories
- **User Story 1+2 (Phases 3-4)**: Both P1, can run after Foundational
- **User Story 3+4 (Phases 5-6)**: Both P2, can run after Foundational (or after US1+2)
- **User Story 5 (Phase 7)**: P3, can run after Foundational
- **Polish (Phase 8)**: After all user stories complete
- **Documentation (Phase 9)**: After Polish
- **Verification (Phase 10-11)**: After Documentation

### User Story Dependencies

| Story | Priority | Dependencies | Notes |
|-------|----------|--------------|-------|
| US1 | P1 | Foundational | Core delay processing |
| US2 | P1 | US1 (extends delay logic) | Spread builds on base delay |
| US3 | P2 | Foundational | Independent freeze feature |
| US4 | P2 | US1 (uses delay lines) | Feedback extends delay logic |
| US5 | P3 | Foundational | Independent diffusion |

### Parallel Opportunities

Within each user story phase:
- All tests marked [P] can run in parallel
- Test writing parallelizes with no dependencies

Across phases:
- US3 and US5 are independent from US1/US2/US4
- With multiple developers: split by user story

---

## Parallel Example: User Story 1

```bash
# Launch all tests for User Story 1 together:
Task: "Write tests for uniform delay in tests/unit/features/spectral_delay_test.cpp"
Task: "Write tests for dry/wet mix in tests/unit/features/spectral_delay_test.cpp"
Task: "Write tests for output gain in tests/unit/features/spectral_delay_test.cpp"
```

---

## Implementation Strategy

### MVP First (User Stories 1+2 Only)

1. Complete Phase 1: Setup
2. Complete Phase 2: Foundational
3. Complete Phase 3: User Story 1 (Basic Spectral Delay)
4. Complete Phase 4: User Story 2 (Spread Control)
5. **STOP and VALIDATE**: Test spectral delay with spread
6. Deploy/demo if ready

### Incremental Delivery

1. Setup + Foundational → Foundation ready
2. Add US1 (Basic Delay) → Core effect working
3. Add US2 (Spread) → Frequency-dependent delays
4. Add US3 (Freeze) → Infinite sustain
5. Add US4 (Feedback) → Evolving textures
6. Add US5 (Diffusion) → Spectral smearing
7. Each story adds value without breaking previous stories
