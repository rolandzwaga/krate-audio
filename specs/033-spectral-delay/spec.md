# Feature Specification: Spectral Delay

**Feature Branch**: `033-spectral-delay`
**Created**: 2025-12-26
**Status**: Draft
**Input**: User description: "Layer 4 user feature that applies delay to individual frequency bands using STFT analysis/resynthesis for ethereal, frequency-dependent echo effects"

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### User Story 1 - Basic Spectral Delay (Priority: P1)

As an ambient music producer, I want to apply different delay times to different frequency bands, so I can create ethereal, frequency-smeared delay effects where high frequencies echo at different rates than low frequencies.

**Why this priority**: Core functionality - the fundamental spectral delay effect that differentiates this from time-domain delays. Without per-band delay, this is just a regular delay with extra latency.

**Independent Test**: Can be fully tested by feeding an impulse or transient through the delay and verifying that different frequency bands arrive at different times in the output.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** spectral delay is enabled with uniform delay across bands, **When** an impulse is processed, **Then** output resembles a time-domain delay (coherent echo)
2. **Given** low bands set to 500ms delay and high bands set to 100ms delay, **When** a transient is processed, **Then** high frequencies echo first, followed by low frequencies
3. **Given** delay times vary linearly across bands, **When** a chord is processed, **Then** each harmonic echoes at a different time creating a "smear" effect
4. **Given** dry/wet mix is at 50%, **When** audio is processed, **Then** original transients are preserved alongside spectral echoes

### User Story 2 - Delay Spread Control (Priority: P1)

As a sound designer, I want a simple spread control that automatically distributes delay times across frequency bands, so I can quickly dial in frequency-dependent delays without manually setting each band.

**Why this priority**: Usability - manually setting 16+ band delays is impractical. Spread control makes the effect accessible for real-world use.

**Independent Test**: Can be tested by adjusting spread from 0% to 100% and verifying delay times progressively differ more between low and high bands.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** spread is 0%, **When** audio is processed, **Then** all bands have the same delay time (base delay)
2. **Given** spread is 100% with positive direction, **When** audio is processed, **Then** high bands have maximum offset from base delay
3. **Given** spread is 100% with negative direction, **When** audio is processed, **Then** low bands have maximum offset from base delay
4. **Given** base delay is 500ms and spread adds up to 500ms, **When** at maximum spread, **Then** delay range spans 500ms to 1000ms across bands

---

### User Story 3 - Spectral Freeze (Priority: P2)

As an ambient artist, I want to freeze the current spectrum indefinitely, so I can create infinite sustain drone textures from any audio source.

**Why this priority**: Creative feature that leverages the spectral domain - holding magnitude/phase creates pad-like textures impossible with time-domain delays.

**Independent Test**: Can be tested by enabling freeze during a sustained note, then stopping input and verifying output continues indefinitely with the frozen spectrum.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** freeze is enabled, **When** input stops, **Then** the frozen spectrum continues playing indefinitely
2. **Given** freeze is enabled, **When** new input arrives, **Then** frozen spectrum is NOT updated (holds original)
3. **Given** freeze is disabled after being enabled, **When** new input arrives, **Then** normal spectral delay processing resumes
4. **Given** freeze transition occurs, **When** enabling/disabling freeze, **Then** transition is smooth (crossfade) without clicks

---

### User Story 4 - Frequency-Dependent Feedback (Priority: P2)

As an experimental musician, I want different feedback amounts per frequency band, so I can create evolving textures where some frequencies build up while others decay quickly.

**Why this priority**: Expands creative palette significantly - allows sculpting which frequencies sustain in the feedback loop.

**Independent Test**: Can be tested by setting high feedback on low bands and low feedback on high bands, then verifying low frequencies sustain longer in the delay tail.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** uniform feedback at 50%, **When** audio decays, **Then** all frequency bands decay at the same rate
2. **Given** feedback tilt toward low frequencies, **When** audio decays, **Then** low frequencies sustain longer than highs
3. **Given** feedback tilt toward high frequencies, **When** audio decays, **Then** high frequencies sustain longer than lows
4. **Given** feedback exceeds 100% on some bands, **When** processing, **Then** those bands are soft-limited to prevent runaway oscillation

---

### User Story 5 - Spectral Diffusion/Smear (Priority: P3)

As a sound designer, I want to smear the spectrum over time, so transients become soft, evolving textures with blurred frequency content.

**Why this priority**: Polish feature that adds organic character - spectral smearing creates unique textures not achievable otherwise.

**Independent Test**: Can be tested by processing a sharp transient with high diffusion and verifying the output has softened attack and blurred spectral content.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** diffusion is 0%, **When** audio is processed, **Then** spectral content is unchanged (clean delay)
2. **Given** diffusion is 100%, **When** a transient is processed, **Then** attack is significantly softened and frequencies blur together
3. **Given** diffusion is applied, **When** processing tonal content, **Then** harmonics spread into neighboring bins creating a "shimmer"

### Edge Cases

- What happens when FFT size is larger than audio buffer? System accumulates samples across multiple process() calls using overlap-add
- What happens when delay time is shorter than FFT latency? Minimum effective delay is FFT size / 2 samples (analysis latency)
- What happens with DC offset in input? DC bin (bin 0) should be handled carefully - either zeroed or delayed like other bins
- What happens at extreme spread values? Delay times are clamped to valid range (0 to max delay buffer)
- What happens when sample rate changes? All delay lines and STFT must be re-prepared with new sample rate

## Assumptions & Existing Components *(mandatory)*

### Assumptions

- STFT (Layer 1) provides real-time safe analysis/resynthesis
- SpectralBuffer (Layer 1) provides magnitude/phase storage and manipulation
- FFT (Layer 1) provides forward/inverse transforms
- Users understand basic delay concepts (time, feedback, mix)
- FFT size selection involves latency/frequency-resolution tradeoff (larger = more resolution, more latency)

### Existing Codebase Components (Principle XIV)

*GATE: Must identify before `/speckit.plan` to prevent ODR violations.*

**Relevant existing components that may be reused or extended:**

| Component | Location | Relevance |
|-----------|----------|-----------|
| STFT | src/dsp/primitives/stft.h | Core analysis/resynthesis - REUSE |
| SpectralBuffer | src/dsp/primitives/spectral_buffer.h | Spectrum storage - REUSE |
| FFT | src/dsp/primitives/fft.h | Transform engine - indirect dep via STFT |
| DelayLine | src/dsp/primitives/delay_line.h | Per-bin delays - REUSE (multiple instances) |
| OnePoleSmoother | src/dsp/primitives/smoother.h | Parameter smoothing - REUSE |
| ShimmerDelay | src/dsp/features/shimmer_delay.h | Reference architecture for Layer 4 features |

**Initial codebase search for key terms:**

```bash
grep -r "class STFT" src/
grep -r "SpectralBuffer" src/
grep -r "spectral" src/dsp/
```

**Search Results Summary**:
- STFT exists at Layer 1 with prepare/process/getSpectrum interface
- SpectralBuffer provides getMagnitude/getPhase/setMagnitude for bin manipulation
- No existing "spectral delay" implementation found

### Forward Reusability Consideration

**Sibling features at same layer**:
- Granular Delay (future) may reuse spectral analysis for grain windowing
- Vocoder effects could share spectral processing infrastructure

**Potential shared components**:
- Per-bin processing pattern could be extracted if other spectral effects emerge
- Spectral freeze logic could be shared with future freeze effects
