# Specification Quality Checklist: Master Section Panel - Wire Voice & Output Controls

**Purpose**: Validate specification completeness and quality before proceeding to planning
**Created**: 2026-02-14
**Feature**: [spec.md](../spec.md)

## Content Quality

- [X] No implementation details (languages, frameworks, APIs)
- [X] Focused on user value and business needs
- [X] Written for non-technical stakeholders
- [X] All mandatory sections completed

**Notes**: The spec references specific file paths, parameter IDs, and VSTGUI control types in the "Existing Codebase Components" section. This is intentional and required by the project's spec template (Principle XIV) to prevent ODR violations. The user scenarios and requirements themselves are written at the behavioral level ("the user sees a dropdown", "selecting Mono causes monophonic behavior") without prescribing implementation.

## Requirement Completeness

- [X] No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers remain
- [X] Requirements are testable and unambiguous
- [X] Success criteria are measurable
- [X] Success criteria are technology-agnostic (no implementation details)
- [X] All acceptance scenarios are defined
- [X] Edge cases are identified
- [X] Scope is clearly bounded
- [X] Dependencies and assumptions identified

## Feature Readiness

- [X] All functional requirements have clear acceptance criteria
- [X] User scenarios cover primary flows
- [X] Feature meets measurable outcomes defined in Success Criteria
- [X] No implementation details leak into specification

## Notes

- All checklist items pass. Spec is ready for `/speckit.clarify` or `/speckit.plan`.
- The spec correctly identifies that DSP code for Width and Spread already exists in the engine and only needs parameter pipeline wiring.
- Backward compatibility with old presets is explicitly addressed in FR-018 and the Edge Cases section.
- Phase 3 (Mono Mode conditional panel) is explicitly scoped out -- the Polyphony dropdown stays visible in Mono mode for now.
