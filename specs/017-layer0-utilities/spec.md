# Feature Specification: Layer 0 Utilities (BlockContext, FastMath, Interpolation)

**Feature Branch**: `017-layer0-utilities`
**Created**: 2025-12-24
**Status**: Complete
**Input**: User description: "Layer 0 Completion: BlockContext and FastMath utilities for Layer 3 readiness. Add BlockContext struct to carry per-block processing context (sample rate, block size, tempo BPM, transport state, time signature) needed for tempo-synced features. Add FastMath utilities with optimized approximations (fastSin, fastCos, fastTanh, fastExp) for CPU-critical paths like feedback saturation. Add standalone Interpolation utilities (linear, cubic Hermite, Lagrange) extracted from DelayLine for reuse across primitives. All must be constexpr where possible, noexcept, and have no dependencies on Layer 1+."

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### User Story 1 - BlockContext for Tempo Sync (Priority: P1)

As a developer building the Layer 3 Delay Engine, I need access to tempo and transport information so that I can implement tempo-synced delay times (quarter notes, dotted eighths, triplets, etc.).

**Why this priority**: Tempo sync is essential for the core delay plugin functionality. Without BlockContext, Layer 3 cannot implement tempo-synced delay times, which is a fundamental feature for any modern delay plugin.

**Independent Test**: Can be fully tested by creating a BlockContext with tempo data and verifying that tempo-to-samples calculations produce correct results for common note values (1/4, 1/8, dotted, triplets).

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** a BlockContext with 120 BPM tempo and 44100 Hz sample rate, **When** I calculate delay samples for a quarter note, **Then** I get 22050 samples (0.5 seconds)
2. **Given** a BlockContext with 90 BPM and 48000 Hz sample rate, **When** I calculate delay samples for a dotted eighth note, **Then** I get 24000 samples (dotted eighth = 0.75 beats × 0.667 sec/beat × 48000 Hz)
3. **Given** a BlockContext with transport playing, **When** I query the transport state, **Then** I can determine if playback is active for LFO sync decisions

### User Story 2 - FastMath for CPU-Critical Paths (Priority: P2)

As a developer implementing feedback saturation in Layer 2/3, I need fast approximations of transcendental functions (sin, tanh, exp) so that I can maintain real-time performance without sacrificing audio quality.

**Why this priority**: Feedback paths may call saturation (tanh) thousands of times per block. Standard library functions are accurate but slow. FastMath enables higher-quality processing within CPU budgets.

**Independent Test**: Can be tested by comparing fastTanh output against std::tanh for a range of inputs, verifying accuracy within tolerance, and measuring CPU cycles per call.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** an input value of 0.5, **When** I call fastTanh(0.5), **Then** the result is within 0.1% of std::tanh(0.5)
2. **Given** an input value of 3.0 (saturation region), **When** I call fastTanh(3.0), **Then** the result is within 0.5% of std::tanh(3.0)
3. **Given** a buffer of 512 samples, **When** I apply fastTanh to each sample, **Then** processing completes in less than 50% of the time required by std::tanh

---

### User Story 3 - Standalone Interpolation Utilities (Priority: P3)

As a developer building pitch shifters, resamplers, or other DSP primitives, I need access to interpolation functions (linear, cubic Hermite, Lagrange) as standalone utilities so that I don't duplicate code across components.

**Why this priority**: Currently interpolation is inline in DelayLine. Other components (PitchShifter, Oversampler) may benefit from shared, optimized implementations. Extraction prevents code duplication and enables consistent behavior.

**Independent Test**: Can be tested by interpolating between known sample values and verifying results match expected mathematical outputs.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** samples [0.0, 1.0] at positions 0 and 1, **When** I call linearInterpolate at position 0.5, **Then** I get exactly 0.5
2. **Given** a sine wave sampled at 4 points, **When** I call cubicHermiteInterpolate between samples, **Then** the result is closer to the true sine value than linear interpolation
3. **Given** 4 consecutive samples, **When** I call lagrangeInterpolate at the midpoint, **Then** the result matches the expected 3rd-order polynomial value

---

### User Story 4 - Constexpr Math Constants and Calculations (Priority: P3)

As a developer, I need math utilities that work at compile-time so that I can pre-compute lookup tables, filter coefficients, and other constants without runtime overhead.

**Why this priority**: Constexpr evaluation enables zero-cost abstractions. Tables computed at compile-time eliminate initialization overhead and improve cache behavior.

**Independent Test**: Can be tested by using constexpr functions in static_assert or constexpr variable initialization and verifying compilation succeeds.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** a constexpr-capable fastSin function, **When** I initialize a constexpr array with pre-computed sine values, **Then** the code compiles and values are correct
2. **Given** tempoToSamples as a constexpr function, **When** I use it in a constexpr context, **Then** compilation succeeds with correct values

---

### Edge Cases

- What happens when tempo is 0 or negative? (Should clamp to minimum reasonable value, e.g., 20 BPM)
- What happens when fastTanh receives NaN or infinity? (Should return appropriate limit or NaN)
- What happens when interpolation position is exactly at a sample boundary? (Should return the exact sample value)
- What happens when interpolation position is outside the valid range [0, 1)? (Should handle gracefully - clamp or extrapolate)
- What happens when sample rate is 0? (Should prevent division by zero)

### Existing Codebase Components (Principle XIV)

*GATE: Must identify before `/speckit.plan` to prevent ODR violations.*

**Relevant existing components that may be reused or extended:**

| Component | Location | Relevance |
|-----------|----------|-----------|
| kPi, kTwoPi constants | src/dsp/core/math_constants.h | MUST use - centralized constants |
| dbToGain, gainToDb | src/dsp/core/db_utils.h | Reference - similar constexpr patterns |
| DelayLine interpolation | src/dsp/primitives/delay_line.h | Extract - current inline implementations |
| constexprExp, constexprLog10 | src/dsp/core/db_utils.h | Reference - Taylor series pattern |

**Initial codebase search for key terms:**

```bash
# Run these searches to identify existing implementations
grep -r "fastSin\|fastTanh\|fastExp" src/
grep -r "linearInterpolate\|cubicInterpolate\|lagrange" src/
grep -r "BlockContext\|ProcessContext\|tempo" src/
grep -r "interpolat" src/dsp/primitives/delay_line.h
```

**Search Results Summary**: To be filled during planning phase
