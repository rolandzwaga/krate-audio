Based on synthesis, electronic music, and engineering forums, the most unusual oscillator types often break away from standard sine/square/saw waves, relying on recursion, complex feedback, or non-traditional synthesis methods.
Here are some of the most unusual oscillator types, categorized by their, quirkiness:

1. Recursive/Unusual Circuit Oscillators (NRG)
The "Novel Rectangle Generator" (NRG): Described by Delton Horn, this type utilizes a recursive feedback network, often chaining three or more stages where Stage 1 triggers Stage 2, which triggers Stage 3, and so on, closing back to Stage 1. Using unequal components causes non-linear, unpredictable, and "jerky" rhythms rather than a smooth, constant frequency.
Chaos Circuits (e.g., Triple Cap Chaos): These generate signals based on chaotic, non-linear mathematics, creating unpredictable, evolving, and sometimes erratic voltage fluctuations that can be used at audio rates for extremely "bizarre" sound.

2. Physical Modeling and "Accidental" Oscillators
Karplus-Strong (String Modeling): While often used as a filter effect, Karplus-Strong operates as an oscillator by feeding a short burst of noise into a very short, high-feedback delay line. It produces plucked, string-like tones that are unnatural for traditional synthesizers.
"Pinging" a Filter/VCA: A very common, yet "unusual" technique, where a sharp, percussive trigger is sent through a resonant filter or a VCA set to self-oscillate, effectively using a filtering component as a sound source.

3. Digital and Polytemporal Synthesis
Polygonal Synthesis (e.g., Polygogo): This involves generating sounds by manipulating a visual polygon on a screen, with the number of corners (order) and the rotation (roll) of the polygon directly shaping the complex, shifting harmonic content.
Scanned Synthesis: A hybrid technique that uses a low-frequency oscillator to "scan" a wave table that is being actively modified by a physical model, creating slowly evolving, harsh, and organic textures.
Additive/Partial Oscillators (e.g., Xaoc Odessa): Rather than shaping a waveform, these oscillators generate and control hundreds of individual sine wave partials (harmonics) simultaneously, allowing for very metallic or unnatural tones.

4. Non-Standard Techniques
Feedback Loops: Using a mixer or filter to feed a signal back into its own input can create self-oscillating, unstable, and complex sound sources.
Envelopes/LFOs as VCOs: A standard envelope generator or Low-Frequency Oscillator (LFO) that is allowed to run fast enough (audio rate) can become an oscillator, but because they are designed for shaping, they often have irregular, "strangle" sounds.
In summary, the Novel Rectangle Generator or Non-linear Chaos circuits are often considered the most "unusual" in terms of design, while Polygonal and Scanned Synthesis are unique in their sound generation methods.
