# Specification Quality Checklist: FM Voice System

**Purpose**: Validate specification completeness and quality before proceeding to planning
**Created**: 2026-02-05
**Feature**: [spec.md](../spec.md)

## Content Quality

- [x] No implementation details (languages, frameworks, APIs)
- [x] Focused on user value and business needs
- [x] Written for non-technical stakeholders
- [x] All mandatory sections completed

## Requirement Completeness

- [x] No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers remain
- [x] Requirements are testable and unambiguous
- [x] Success criteria are measurable
- [x] Success criteria are technology-agnostic (no implementation details)
- [x] All acceptance scenarios are defined
- [x] Edge cases are identified
- [x] Scope is clearly bounded
- [x] Dependencies and assumptions identified

## Feature Readiness

- [x] All functional requirements have clear acceptance criteria
- [x] User scenarios cover primary flows
- [x] Feature meets measurable outcomes defined in Success Criteria
- [x] No implementation details leak into specification

## Validation Summary

| Category | Pass | Fail | Notes |
|----------|------|------|-------|
| Content Quality | 4 | 0 | All items pass |
| Requirement Completeness | 8 | 0 | All items pass |
| Feature Readiness | 4 | 0 | All items pass |
| **Total** | **16** | **0** | Ready for planning |

## Notes

- Spec is ready for `/speckit.clarify` or `/speckit.plan`
- Number of operators (4 vs 6) left as implementation decision per FR-009 to allow flexibility during planning
- Algorithm set (8 algorithms) provides good coverage of classic FM topologies based on research
- Existing FMOperator at Layer 2 provides the foundation; this Layer 3 system composes them
