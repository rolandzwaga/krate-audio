# Feature Specification: Granular Delay

**Feature Branch**: `034-granular-delay`
**Created**: 2025-12-27
**Status**: Draft
**Input**: User description: "Layer 4 user feature that breaks incoming audio into small grains (1-500ms) and reassembles them with per-grain pitch shifting, position randomization, reverse probability, and density control. Uses a tapped delay line architecture for real-time granular processing with freeze capability for infinite sustain textures."

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### User Story 1 - Basic Granular Texture (Priority: P1)

As a sound designer, I want to transform incoming audio into granular textures by controlling grain size and density, so I can create everything from subtle shimmer to completely fragmented, glitchy effects.

**Why this priority**: Core functionality - grain size and density are the fundamental parameters that define granular synthesis. Without these working, no other granular feature is possible.

**Independent Test**: Can be fully tested by feeding audio through the effect, adjusting grain size from 10ms to 500ms and density from 1 to 50 grains/second, and verifying the output texture changes from smooth echoes to choppy fragments.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** a sustained input signal and grain size of 100ms at density 10 Hz, **When** audio is processed, **Then** output consists of overlapping grains creating a textured delay
2. **Given** grain size of 10ms and density 50 Hz, **When** audio is processed, **Then** output is nearly continuous with subtle granular artifacts
3. **Given** grain size of 500ms and density 2 Hz, **When** audio is processed, **Then** output consists of distinct, separated chunks with audible gaps
4. **Given** dry/wet mix at 50%, **When** audio is processed, **Then** original signal blends with granular texture

### User Story 2 - Per-Grain Pitch Shifting (Priority: P2)

As an ambient music producer, I want to apply pitch shifting to individual grains with optional randomization, so I can create shimmering, evolving textures where each grain contributes a different pitch.

**Why this priority**: Pitch shifting is the key creative parameter that differentiates granular delay from time-domain delays. It enables shimmer-like effects and harmonic richness.

**Independent Test**: Can be tested by setting a fixed pitch shift (e.g., +12 semitones) and verifying all grains play back an octave higher, then enabling pitch spray and verifying grains have randomized pitches around the target.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** pitch shift of +12 semitones with 0% spray, **When** audio is processed, **Then** all grains play back exactly one octave higher
2. **Given** pitch shift of -7 semitones with 0% spray, **When** audio is processed, **Then** all grains play back a perfect fifth lower
3. **Given** pitch shift of 0 semitones with 50% spray, **When** audio is processed, **Then** grains have randomized pitches within +/- 6 semitones of original
4. **Given** extreme pitch shift (+24 semitones), **When** audio is processed, **Then** grains still play cleanly without severe aliasing

### User Story 3 - Position Randomization (Priority: P2)

As a sound designer, I want to control how far back in time each grain reads from the delay buffer, with optional randomization, so I can create scattered, non-linear echoes that smear audio across time.

**Why this priority**: Position control (delay time + spray) enables the characteristic "time smearing" effect of granular delays. It works alongside pitch shifting as a core creative parameter.

**Independent Test**: Can be tested by setting delay time to 500ms with 0% spray and verifying all grains tap the same point, then enabling spray and verifying grains tap random positions within the spray range.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** delay time 500ms with position spray 0%, **When** audio is processed, **Then** all grains read from the same delay position (coherent echo)
2. **Given** delay time 500ms with position spray 100%, **When** audio is processed, **Then** grains read from random positions between 0-1000ms creating scattered texture
3. **Given** delay time 0ms with position spray 50%, **When** audio is processed, **Then** grains read from positions between 0-250ms creating immediate scatter
4. **Given** maximum delay time 2000ms, **When** audio is processed, **Then** grains can tap up to 2 seconds into the past

### User Story 4 - Reverse Grain Playback (Priority: P3)

As an experimental musician, I want to randomly reverse some grains while others play forward, so I can create textures that blend forward and backward elements for otherworldly effects.

**Why this priority**: Reverse playback adds significant creative value but builds on the core grain system. It's an enhancement rather than core functionality.

**Independent Test**: Can be tested by setting reverse probability to 100% and verifying all grains play backward, then 50% and verifying roughly half play backward.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** reverse probability 0%, **When** audio is processed, **Then** all grains play forward
2. **Given** reverse probability 100%, **When** audio is processed, **Then** all grains play backward
3. **Given** reverse probability 50%, **When** 100 grains are generated, **Then** approximately 40-60 grains play backward (statistical distribution)
4. **Given** reverse grain playback, **When** grain completes, **Then** no clicks or discontinuities at grain boundaries

---

### User Story 5 - Granular Freeze (Priority: P3)

As an ambient artist, I want to freeze the delay buffer and continuously generate grains from the frozen content, so I can create infinite sustain drone textures from any audio source.

**Why this priority**: Freeze is a powerful creative feature but requires the core granular system to be working first. It transforms the effect from a delay into an instrument.

**Independent Test**: Can be tested by playing audio, enabling freeze, stopping input, and verifying grains continue indefinitely from frozen buffer content.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** freeze is enabled, **When** input stops, **Then** grains continue playing from frozen buffer indefinitely
2. **Given** freeze is enabled, **When** new input arrives, **Then** frozen buffer is NOT updated (holds original content)
3. **Given** freeze is disabled after being enabled, **When** new input arrives, **Then** buffer resumes capturing new audio
4. **Given** freeze transition occurs, **When** enabling/disabling freeze, **Then** transition is smooth (crossfade) without clicks

---

### User Story 6 - Feedback Path (Priority: P4)

As an electronic music producer, I want granulated output fed back into the delay buffer, so I can create building, evolving textures where grains become increasingly processed.

**Why this priority**: Feedback adds depth and evolution but is an enhancement layer on top of core granular processing.

**Independent Test**: Can be tested by setting high feedback (80%) and verifying delayed grains become re-granulated, creating increasingly dense textures.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** feedback at 0%, **When** input stops, **Then** grains decay naturally after buffer content is exhausted
2. **Given** feedback at 50%, **When** input stops, **Then** grains gradually decay over multiple cycles
3. **Given** feedback at 100%, **When** audio is processed, **Then** grains sustain indefinitely without runaway oscillation
4. **Given** feedback exceeds 100%, **When** audio is processed, **Then** signal is soft-limited to prevent clipping

### Edge Cases

- What happens when grain size exceeds delay buffer length? Grain size is clamped to maximum delay time
- What happens when density is so high grains fully overlap? System handles polyphony up to maximum voice count, older grains are stolen if exceeded
- What happens when pitch shift causes grain to exceed buffer? Read position wraps within buffer bounds
- What happens when sample rate changes? All buffers and grain state must be re-initialized
- What happens with DC offset in input? DC should pass through naturally (no blocking needed for granular)
- What happens when freeze is enabled with empty buffer? Grains play silence until buffer has content

## Assumptions & Existing Components *(mandatory)*

### Assumptions

- Users understand basic delay concepts (time, feedback, mix)
- Grain size selection involves texture/latency tradeoff (larger = smoother, more latency)
- Default grain envelope is Hann window (raised cosine)
- Default scheduling is asynchronous (stochastic timing based on density)
- Pitch shifting uses linear interpolation by default (acceptable quality for granular)

### Existing Codebase Components (Principle XIV)

*GATE: Must identify before `/speckit.plan` to prevent ODR violations.*

**Relevant existing components that may be reused or extended:**

| Component | Location | Relevance |
|-----------|----------|-----------|
| DelayLine | src/dsp/primitives/delay_line.h | Core buffer - REUSE with interpolated read |
| OnePoleSmoother | src/dsp/primitives/smoother.h | Parameter smoothing - REUSE |
| MultimodeFilter | src/dsp/processors/multimode_filter.h | Optional per-grain filtering |
| FlexibleFeedbackNetwork | src/dsp/processors/flexible_feedback_network.h | Feedback path model |
| ReverseBuffer | src/dsp/primitives/reverse_buffer.h | Reference for reverse playback |

**Initial codebase search for key terms:**

```bash
grep -r "class Grain" src/
grep -r "granular" src/dsp/
grep -r "grain" src/dsp/
```

**Search Results Summary**: No existing granular implementations found. Will need new components.

### Forward Reusability Consideration

**Sibling features at same layer**:
- None planned - this is the final Layer 4 feature per roadmap

**Potential shared components**:
- GrainPool pattern could be useful for future particle/cloud effects
- Grain envelope lookup tables could be shared with future STFT processing
- Voice stealing algorithm could be extracted to Layer 0 if needed elsewhere
