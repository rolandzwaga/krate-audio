# Tasks: Delay Line DSP Primitive

**Input**: Design documents from `/specs/002-delay-line/`
**Prerequisites**: plan.md (required), spec.md (required for user stories), research.md, data-model.md, contracts/

**Tests**: This project follows TEST-FIRST methodology (Constitution Principle XII). Tests MUST be written before implementation.

**Organization**: Tasks are grouped by user story to enable independent implementation and testing of each story.

---

## MANDATORY: Test-First Development Workflow

**CRITICAL**: Every implementation task MUST follow this workflow. These are not guidelines - they are requirements.

### Required Steps for EVERY Task

Before starting ANY implementation task, include these as EXPLICIT todo items:

1. **Context Check**: Verify `specs/TESTING-GUIDE.md` is in context window. If not, READ IT FIRST.
2. **Write Failing Tests**: Create test file and write tests that FAIL (no implementation yet)
3. **Implement**: Write code to make tests pass
4. **Verify**: Run tests and confirm they pass
5. **Commit**: Commit the completed work

---

## Format: `[ID] [P?] [Story] Description`

- **[P]**: Can run in parallel (different files, no dependencies)
- **[Story]**: Which user story this task belongs to (e.g., US1, US2, US3)
- Include exact file paths in descriptions

---

**Checkpoint**: Directory structure ready for implementation

---

## Phase 2: Foundational (Blocking Prerequisites)

## Dependencies & Execution Order

### Phase Dependencies

- **Setup (Phase 1)**: No dependencies - can start immediately
- **Foundational (Phase 2)**: Depends on Setup completion - BLOCKS all user stories
- **US1 (Phase 3)**: Depends on Foundational - MVP, complete first
- **US2 (Phase 4)**: Depends on US1 (uses write/read infrastructure)
- **US3 (Phase 5)**: Depends on US1 (uses write/read infrastructure)
- **US5 (Phase 6)**: Can run after US1-US3, verifies RT safety
- **Polish (Phase 7)**: Depends on all user stories
- **Documentation (Phase 8)**: Final phase

```

### Parallel Opportunities

After Phase 2 (Foundational) completes:
- US2 (Linear Interpolation) and US3 (Allpass) can run in parallel
- Both depend only on US1 infrastructure

Within each user story:
- Tests marked [P] can be written in parallel
- Implementation tasks must be sequential within story

---

## Parallel Example: After US1 Complete

```bash
# These can run in parallel after US1 is done:
Agent A: "Implement US2 - Linear Interpolation"
Agent B: "Implement US3 - Allpass Interpolation"

# Both use the same write/read infrastructure from US1
# No file conflicts (all implementation in same header, but different methods)
```

---

## Implementation Strategy

### MVP First (User Story 1 Only)

1. Complete Phase 1: Setup
2. Complete Phase 2: Foundational (CRITICAL - blocks all stories)
3. Complete Phase 3: User Story 1 (Basic Fixed Delay)
4. **STOP and VALIDATE**: Test with simple delay scenario
5. This alone enables basic delay effects

### Incremental Delivery

1. **MVP (US1)**: Basic fixed delay → enables simple delay effects
2. **+US2**: Linear interpolation → enables chorus/flanger/vibrato
3. **+US3**: Allpass interpolation → enables feedback delay networks
4. **+US5**: RT safety verification → production-ready
5. Each increment adds capability without breaking previous functionality
