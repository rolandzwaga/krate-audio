# Tasks: Pitch Shift Processor

**Input**: Design documents from `/specs/016-pitch-shifter/`
**Prerequisites**: plan.md, spec.md, research.md, data-model.md, contracts/

**Tests**: This project follows TEST-FIRST methodology (Constitution Principle XII). Tests MUST be written before implementation.

**Organization**: Tasks are grouped by user story to enable independent implementation and testing of each story.

---

## ⚠️ MANDATORY: Test-First Development Workflow

**CRITICAL**: Every implementation task MUST follow this workflow. These are not guidelines - they are requirements.

### Required Steps for EVERY Task

Before starting ANY implementation task, include these as EXPLICIT todo items:

1. **Context Check**: Verify `specs/TESTING-GUIDE.md` is in context window. If not, READ IT FIRST.
2. **Write Failing Tests**: Create test file and write tests that FAIL (no implementation yet)
3. **Implement**: Write code to make tests pass
4. **Verify**: Run tests and confirm they pass
5. **Commit**: Commit the completed work

### Cross-Platform Compatibility Check (After Each User Story)

**CRITICAL for VST3 projects**: The VST3 SDK enables `-ffast-math` globally, which breaks IEEE 754 compliance. After implementing tests, verify:

1. **IEEE 754 Function Usage**: If any test file uses `std::isnan()`, `std::isfinite()`, `std::isinf()`, or NaN/infinity detection:
   - Add the file to the `-fno-fast-math` list in `tests/CMakeLists.txt`

2. **Floating-Point Precision**: Use `Approx().margin()` for comparisons, not exact equality

---

## Format: `[ID] [P?] [Story] Description`

- **[P]**: Can run in parallel (different files, no dependencies)

- [ ] T111 **Review ALL SC-xxx success criteria** (SC-001 to SC-008) and verify measurable targets are achieved
- [ ] T112 **Search for cheating patterns** in implementation:
  - [ ] No `// placeholder` or `// TODO` comments in new code
  - [ ] No test thresholds relaxed from spec requirements
  - [ ] No features quietly removed from scope

### 11.2 Fill Compliance Table in spec.md

- [ ] T113 **Update spec.md "Implementation Verification" section** with compliance status for each requirement

## Dependencies & Execution Order

### Phase Dependencies

- **Setup (Phase 1)**: No dependencies - can start immediately
- **Foundational (Phase 2)**: Depends on Setup completion - BLOCKS all user stories
- **User Stories (Phase 3-8)**: All depend on Foundational phase completion
  - US1 (P1): Core pitch shifting with Simple mode
  - US2 (P1): Add Granular and PhaseVocoder modes (extends US1)
  - US3 (P2): Cents support (builds on any mode)
  - US4 (P2): Formant preservation (requires US2 for Granular/PhaseVocoder)
  - US5 (P2): Feedback stability (builds on all modes)
  - US6 (P3): Parameter smoothing (enhances all)
- **Polish (Phase 9)**: Depends on all user stories being complete
- **Documentation (Phase 10)**: Depends on Polish
- **Verification (Phase 11)**: Depends on Documentation
- **Final (Phase 12)**: Depends on Verification

### User Story Dependencies

                      ▼
                   US6 (Automation)
```

### Within Each User Story

1. **TESTING-GUIDE check**: FIRST task
2. **Tests FIRST**: Must FAIL before implementation
3. **Implementation**: Make tests pass
4. **Verify**: All tests pass
5. **Commit**: LAST task

### Parallel Opportunities

**Within Phase 2 (Foundational):**
- T006 and T008 can run in parallel (different utility functions)

**Within Phase 4 (US2):**
- T033 and T034 can run in parallel (different mode tests)

**Within Phase 9 (Polish):**
- T097, T098, T099, T100 can all run in parallel (different edge case tests)

---

## Parallel Example: User Story 2

```bash
# Launch tests for different modes together:
Task: "T033 [P] [US2] Write test: Granular mode produces shifted pitch"
Task: "T034 [P] [US2] Write test: PhaseVocoder mode produces shifted pitch"
```

---

## Implementation Strategy

### MVP First (User Story 1 Only)

1. Complete Phase 1: Setup
2. Complete Phase 2: Foundational
3. Complete Phase 3: User Story 1 (Basic pitch shifting with Simple mode)
4. **STOP and VALIDATE**: Test +/-12 semitone shifts work correctly
5. Can be used immediately for zero-latency monitoring

### Incremental Delivery

1. **MVP (US1)**: Basic pitch shifting works with Simple mode → Deploy for monitoring use
2. **+US2**: Add Granular and PhaseVocoder for quality options → Deploy for mixing use
3. **+US3**: Add cents for fine tuning → Deploy for tuning correction
4. **+US4**: Add formant preservation → Deploy for vocal processing
5. **+US5**: Add feedback stability → Deploy for Shimmer effects
6. **+US6**: Add parameter automation → Deploy for live performance

### Recommended Order

Given US4 (Formant) depends on US2 (Granular/PhaseVocoder modes), and US5 (Feedback) benefits from all modes:

1. US1 → US2 → US3 → US4 → US5 → US6

---

## Notes

- [P] tasks = different files, no dependencies
- [Story] label maps task to specific user story for traceability
- All three internal pitch shifter classes are in the same header file (pattern from DiffusionNetwork)
- FormantPreserver is only used by Granular and PhaseVocoder modes
- Simple mode has unique characteristics: zero latency, no formant preservation possible
- PhaseVocoder implementation is the most complex (phase locking algorithm)
- Layer 1 dependencies: DelayLine, STFT, FFT, SpectralBuffer, OnePoleSmoother, WindowFunctions
