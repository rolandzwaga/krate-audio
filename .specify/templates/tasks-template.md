# Tasks: [FEATURE NAME]

**Input**: Design documents from `/specs/[###-feature-name]/`
**Prerequisites**: plan.md (required), spec.md (required for user stories), research.md, data-model.md, contracts/

**Tests**: This project follows TEST-FIRST methodology (Constitution Principle XII). Tests MUST be written before implementation.

**Organization**: Tasks are grouped by user story to enable independent implementation and testing of each story.

---

## ⚠️ MANDATORY: Test-First Development Workflow

**CRITICAL**: Every implementation task MUST follow this workflow. These are not guidelines - they are requirements.

### Required Steps for EVERY Task

Before starting ANY implementation task, include these as EXPLICIT todo items:

1. **Context Check**: Verify `specs/TESTING-GUIDE.md` is in context window. If not, READ IT FIRST.
2. **Write Failing Tests**: Create test file and write tests that FAIL (no implementation yet)
3. **Implement**: Write code to make tests pass
4. **Verify**: Run tests and confirm they pass
5. **Commit**: Commit the completed work

### Example Todo List Structure

```
[ ] Verify TESTING-GUIDE.md is in context (ingest if needed)
[ ] Write failing tests for [feature]
[ ] Implement [feature] to make tests pass
[ ] Verify all tests pass
[ ] Cross-platform check: verify -fno-fast-math for IEEE 754 functions
[ ] Commit completed work
```

**DO NOT** skip the context check or commit steps. These appear as checkboxes because they MUST be tracked.

### Cross-Platform Compatibility Check (After Each User Story)

**CRITICAL for VST3 projects**: The VST3 SDK enables `-ffast-math` globally, which breaks IEEE 754 compliance. After implementing tests, verify:

1. **IEEE 754 Function Usage**: If any test file uses `std::isnan()`, `std::isfinite()`, `std::isinf()`, or NaN/infinity detection:
   - Add the file to the `-fno-fast-math` list in `tests/CMakeLists.txt`
   - Pattern to add:
     ```cmake
     if(CMAKE_CXX_COMPILER_ID MATCHES "Clang|GNU")
         set_source_files_properties(
             unit/path/to/your_test.cpp  # ADD YOUR FILE HERE
             PROPERTIES COMPILE_FLAGS "-fno-fast-math -fno-finite-math-only"
         )
     endif()
     ```

2. **Floating-Point Precision**: Use `Approx().margin()` for comparisons, not exact equality

3. **Approval Tests**: Use `std::setprecision(6)` or less (MSVC/Clang differ at 7th-8th digits)

This check prevents CI failures on macOS/Linux that pass locally on Windows.

## Format: `[ID] [P?] [Story] Description`

- **[P]**: Can run in parallel (different files, no dependencies)
- **[Story]**: Which user story this task belongs to (e.g., US1, US2, US3)
- Include exact file paths in descriptions

## Path Conventions

- **Single project**: `src/`, `tests/` at repository root
- **Web app**: `backend/src/`, `frontend/src/`
- **Mobile**: `api/src/`, `ios/src/` or `android/src/`
- Paths shown below assume single project - adjust based on plan.md structure

<!-- 
  ============================================================================
  IMPORTANT: The tasks below are SAMPLE TASKS for illustration purposes only.
  
  The /speckit.tasks command MUST replace these with actual tasks based on:
  - User stories from spec.md (with their priorities P1, P2, P3...)
  - Feature requirements from plan.md
  - Entities from data-model.md
  - Endpoints from contracts/
  
  Tasks MUST be organized by user story so each story can be:
  - Implemented independently
  - Tested independently
  - Delivered as an MVP increment
  
  DO NOT keep these sample tasks in the generated tasks.md file.
  ============================================================================

## Phase 1: Setup (Shared Infrastructure)

**Purpose**: Project initialization and basic structure

- [ ] T001 Create project structure per implementation plan
- [ ] T002 Initialize [language] project with [framework] dependencies
- [ ] T003 [P] Configure linting and formatting tools

---

## Phase 2: Foundational (Blocking Prerequisites)

**Purpose**: Core infrastructure that MUST be complete before ANY user story can be implemented

**⚠️ CRITICAL**: No user story work can begin until this phase is complete

Examples of foundational tasks (adjust based on your project):

- [ ] T004 Setup database schema and migrations framework
- [ ] T005 [P] Implement authentication/authorization framework
- [ ] T006 [P] Setup API routing and middleware structure
- [ ] T007 Create base models/entities that all stories depend on
- [ ] T008 Configure error handling and logging infrastructure
- [ ] T009 Setup environment configuration management

**Checkpoint**: Foundation ready - user story implementation can now begin in parallel

---

## Phase 3: User Story 1 - [Title] (Priority: P1) 🎯 MVP

---

[Add more user story phases as needed, following the same pattern]

---

## Phase N-1: Polish & Cross-Cutting Concerns

**Purpose**: Improvements that affect multiple user stories

- [ ] TXXX [P] Documentation updates in docs/
- [ ] TXXX Code cleanup and refactoring
- [ ] TXXX Performance optimization across all stories
- [ ] TXXX [P] Additional unit tests (if requested) in tests/unit/
- [ ] TXXX Security hardening
- [ ] TXXX Run quickstart.md validation

---

## Phase N: Final Documentation (MANDATORY)

**Purpose**: Update living architecture documentation before spec completion

> **Constitution Principle XIII**: Every spec implementation MUST update ARCHITECTURE.md as a final task

### N.1 Architecture Documentation Update

- [ ] TXXX **Update ARCHITECTURE.md** with new components added by this spec:
  - Add new component entries to appropriate layer section
  - Include: purpose, public API summary, file location, "when to use this"
  - Add usage examples if applicable
  - Verify no duplicate functionality was introduced

### N.2 Final Commit

- [ ] TXXX **Commit ARCHITECTURE.md updates**
- [ ] TXXX Verify all spec work is committed to feature branch

**Checkpoint**: Spec implementation complete - ARCHITECTURE.md reflects all new functionality

---

## Dependencies & Execution Order

### Phase Dependencies

- **Setup (Phase 1)**: No dependencies - can start immediately
- **Foundational (Phase 2)**: Depends on Setup completion - BLOCKS all user stories
- **User Stories (Phase 3+)**: All depend on Foundational phase completion
  - User stories can then proceed in parallel (if staffed)
  - Or sequentially in priority order (P1 → P2 → P3)
- **Polish (Final Phase)**: Depends on all desired user stories being complete

### User Story Dependencies

- **User Story 1 (P1)**: Can start after Foundational (Phase 2) - No dependencies on other stories
- **User Story 2 (P2)**: Can start after Foundational (Phase 2) - May integrate with US1 but should be independently testable
- **User Story 3 (P3)**: Can start after Foundational (Phase 2) - May integrate with US1/US2 but should be independently testable

### Within Each User Story

- **TESTING-GUIDE check**: FIRST task - verify testing guide is in context
- **Tests FIRST**: Tests MUST be written and FAIL before implementation (Principle XII)
- Models/entities before services
- Services before endpoints
- Core implementation before integration
- **Verify tests pass**: After implementation
- **Cross-platform check**: Verify IEEE 754 functions have `-fno-fast-math` in tests/CMakeLists.txt
- **Commit**: LAST task - commit completed work
- Story complete before moving to next priority

### Parallel Opportunities

- All Setup tasks marked [P] can run in parallel
- All Foundational tasks marked [P] can run in parallel (within Phase 2)
- Once Foundational phase completes, all user stories can start in parallel (if team capacity allows)
- All tests for a user story marked [P] can run in parallel
- Models within a story marked [P] can run in parallel
- Different user stories can be worked on in parallel by different team members

---

## Parallel Example: User Story 1

```bash
# Launch all tests for User Story 1 together (if tests requested):
Task: "Contract test for [endpoint] in tests/contract/test_[name].py"
Task: "Integration test for [user journey] in tests/integration/test_[name].py"

# Launch all models for User Story 1 together:
Task: "Create [Entity1] model in src/models/[entity1].py"
Task: "Create [Entity2] model in src/models/[entity2].py"
```

---

## Implementation Strategy

### MVP First (User Story 1 Only)

1. Complete Phase 1: Setup
2. Complete Phase 2: Foundational (CRITICAL - blocks all stories)
3. Complete Phase 3: User Story 1
4. **STOP and VALIDATE**: Test User Story 1 independently
5. Deploy/demo if ready

### Incremental Delivery

1. Complete Setup + Foundational → Foundation ready
2. Add User Story 1 → Test independently → Deploy/Demo (MVP!)
3. Add User Story 2 → Test independently → Deploy/Demo
4. Add User Story 3 → Test independently → Deploy/Demo
5. Each story adds value without breaking previous stories

### Parallel Team Strategy

With multiple developers:

1. Team completes Setup + Foundational together
2. Once Foundational is done:
   - Developer A: User Story 1
   - Developer B: User Story 2
   - Developer C: User Story 3
3. Stories complete and integrate independently

---

## Notes

- [P] tasks = different files, no dependencies
- [Story] label maps task to specific user story for traceability
- Each user story should be independently completable and testable
- **MANDATORY**: Check TESTING-GUIDE.md is in context FIRST
- **MANDATORY**: Write tests that FAIL before implementing (Principle XII)
- **MANDATORY**: Verify cross-platform IEEE 754 compliance (add test files to `-fno-fast-math` list)
- **MANDATORY**: Commit work at end of each user story
- **MANDATORY**: Update ARCHITECTURE.md before spec completion (Principle XIII)
- Stop at any checkpoint to validate story independently
- Avoid: vague tasks, same file conflicts, cross-story dependencies that break independence
