description: Convert existing tasks into actionable, dependency-ordered GitHub issues for the feature based on available design artifacts.
tools: ['github/github-mcp-server/issue_write']

## Environment

This project runs on **Windows**. All scripts are PowerShell (.ps1) files in `.specify/scripts/powershell/`. When executing scripts via the Bash tool, use:

```
powershell -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File <script.ps1> [parameters]
```

Do NOT look for or run .sh files.

## User Input

```text
$ARGUMENTS
```

You **MUST** consider the user input before proceeding (if not empty).

## Outline

1. Run `powershell -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File .specify/scripts/powershell/check-prerequisites.ps1 -Json -RequireTasks -IncludeTasks` from repo root and parse FEATURE_DIR and AVAILABLE_DOCS list. All paths must be absolute. For single quotes in args like "I'm Groot", use escape syntax: e.g 'I'\''m Groot' (or double-quote if possible: "I'm Groot").
1. From the executed script, extract the path to **tasks**.
1. Get the Git remote by running:

```bash
git config --get remote.origin.url
```

> [!CAUTION]
> ONLY PROCEED TO NEXT STEPS IF THE REMOTE IS A GITHUB URL

1. For each task in the list, use the GitHub MCP server to create a new issue in the repository that is representative of the Git remote.

> [!CAUTION]
> UNDER NO CIRCUMSTANCES EVER CREATE ISSUES IN REPOSITORIES THAT DO NOT MATCH THE REMOTE URL
