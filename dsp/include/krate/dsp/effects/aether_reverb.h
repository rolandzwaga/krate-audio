// ------------------------------------------------------------------------------
// (2) TOPOLOGY RE-DERIVED FROM fdn_reverb.h, NOT INCLUDED (constraint C-1)
// ------------------------------------------------------------------------------
// This header does NOT include <krate/dsp/effects/fdn_reverb.h> (a Layer 4 ->
// Layer 4 include), nor reverb.h (C-2), nor shimmer_delay.h (C-5). The following
// techniques are re-derived here from those line ranges, which were read while
// writing this file:
//   - Jot per-line absorption, g_i = 10^(-3 * m_i / (T60 * sr))   :576-600
//   - prime reference delay lengths                               :91
//   - one contiguous buffer of per-channel power-of-two sections,
//     each with its own mask and offset                           :638-689
//   - Householder feedback matrix, x[i] -= (2/N) * sum(x)         :749-758
//   - Hadamard feedback matrix via in-place FWHT butterflies      :696-729
//   - freeze bypasses BOTH damping and the DC blocker             :296-322
//   - DC-blocker pole R = 1 - 250/sr                              :207
//   - even/odd output tap split and the M/S width control         :354-371
//   - equal-power dry/wet mix                                     :374-377
//
// ONE DELIBERATE DIVERGENCE IN THAT LIST: the DC blocker is NORMALISED here,
// y = (1+R)/2 * (x - x[n-1]) + R*y[n-1], where fdn_reverb.h uses the bare
// y = x - x[n-1] + R*y[n-1]. The bare form has |H| = 2/(1+R) > 1 above ~550 Hz
// (+0.023 dB per pass at 48 kHz), which inside a recirculating loop is an
// energy SOURCE and contradicts FR-032 outright: at decaySeconds = 60 the
// shortest line's Jot gain is 0.9977, so the Nyquist round-trip gain would be
// 1.0003 - a growing loop, measuring ~105 s against a requested 60 s. The
// prefactor moves the peak magnitude to exactly 1.0 and leaves the pole - and
// therefore the ~40 Hz corner - untouched. See dcBlock().
//
// ------------------------------------------------------------------------------
// (3) MATRIX SIGN CONVENTION (constraint C-8) - NORMATIVE
// ------------------------------------------------------------------------------
// The three morph endpoints M0 (Householder), M1 (Hadamard) and M2 (seeded
// random-orthogonal) must all live in the SAME component of O(N), because det is
// continuous on O(N) and takes only the values +1 and -1: no continuous
// orthogonal path can join a det = +1 endpoint to a det = -1 one.
//   - M0 = I - 2*u0*u0^T with u0 = 1/sqrt(N) is a single reflection, det = -1.
//   - M1 is therefore shipped as D * H_N/sqrt(N) with D = diag(-1, 1, ..., 1):
//     ROW 0 OF THE NORMALISED HADAMARD IS NEGATED. This differs by that sign
//     from fdn_reverb.h:696-729's matrix. Row negation is left-multiplication by
//     an orthogonal +/-1 diagonal, so M1 stays exactly orthogonal while det flips
//     from +1 to -1.
//   - M2's modified-Gram-Schmidt result is forced to det = -1 by negating one
//     column whenever the computed determinant is positive.
//
// ------------------------------------------------------------------------------
// (4) REACHABLE MODAL DENSITY (FR-013), modes/Hz at 48 kHz
// ------------------------------------------------------------------------------
//   N   |  S = 0.25  |  S = 1.0  |  S = 4.0
//   ----+------------+-----------+----------
//    8  |   0.106    |   0.426   |   1.702
//   16  |   0.210    |   0.841   |   3.363
// getModalDensityPerHz() reports sum(effectiveDelay_[i]) / sampleRate_ from the
// CURRENT, Size-scaled lengths - never from the prepare-time geometry.
//
// ------------------------------------------------------------------------------
// (5) SHIMMER LOOP TIME PER PitchMode (FR-054), at 48 kHz
// ------------------------------------------------------------------------------
// Each leg carries 64 samples of tap-cadence deferral ON TOP OF its mode
// latency, because the mono tap sum is accumulated over one control chunk and
// shifted at the next chunk boundary:
//   PitchMode      | mode latency | + cadence | ms @ 48 kHz
//   ---------------+--------------+-----------+-------------
//   Simple         |       0      |     64    |   1.33   (audible artifacts)
//   Granular (def) |    ~2048     |   2112    |  ~44
//   PhaseVocoder   |  4096 + 1024 |   5184    | ~108
// Mode is a prepare-time choice only (FR-053): PitchShiftProcessor's reported
// latency changes immediately on setMode (pitch_shift_processor.h:189-193), and
// a loop whose latency changes mid-render is a click.
//
// ------------------------------------------------------------------------------
// (5b) WHY THE SHIMMER RETURNS DO NOT COMB-FILTER (FR-052) - STATED ACCURATELY
// ------------------------------------------------------------------------------
// NOT because the read subset {N-4 .. N-1} and the injection pairs are disjoint.
// FR-020's endpoints are DENSE (Householder: diagonal 0.75, every off-diagonal
// -0.25 at N = 8; Hadamard: every entry +/-1/sqrt(N)) and the matrix is applied
// once per sample, so after ONE sample step every channel already carries a
// contribution from every other. The disjointness survives zero round trips.
//
// The accurate statement is that A +12 OR +7 COPY IS NOT A COHERENT COPY OF THE
// SIGNAL IT CAME FROM, so the fixed-delay-plus-copy geometry that produces
// classical comb notches does not exist; what remains is a frequency-shifted
// addition at its own send gain. What the pinned subsets actually buy is stereo
// re-diffusion of a MONO tap - each pair spans both parities, so neither
// interval is hard-panned by the even->L / odd->R output split (FR-018) - plus a
// defined, measurable injected level. SC-007 clause 4(b) measures this with a
// no-band-below-its-neighbour-median bound rather than assuming it.
//
// ------------------------------------------------------------------------------
// (5c) FR-059 RETURN FILTER - THE SHIPPED VALUES AND WHY THE FLOOR IS ZERO
// ------------------------------------------------------------------------------
// SHIPPED: corner kReturnShelfCornerHz = 120 Hz (clamped to <= 0.45 * sr) and
// floor kReturnShelfHfGain = 0.0, one filter state per return path (the +12 leg,
// the +7 leg and the bloom - the last at its OWN corner, see (5e)). At a zero
// floor the general shelf
// |H(f)| = sqrt(1 + (g*f/fc)^2) / sqrt(1 + (f/fc)^2) degenerates to the pure
// one-pole lowpass 1 / sqrt(1 + (f/fc)^2) that FR-059's "one-pole, corner
// documented in the header" permits: 1.00 at DC, 0.34 at 330 Hz, 0.26 at 440 Hz,
// 0.119 at 1 kHz, 0.0150 at 8 kHz, 0.0075 at 16 kHz.
//
// The plan's R-1 starting point was 6 kHz / 0.5 and named this filter as the ONLY
// admissible lever, with "lower the corner and/or the shelf gain and record the
// shipped values" as the remedy. Both were lowered, and then the FLOOR had to go
// all the way to zero. The values are MEASURED, not derived - the closed-form
// energy balance this note used to carry was wrong by ~1.8x in amplitude (it
// assumed the four tapped lines are mutually decorrelated and that the injected
// copy is incoherent with the loop content it is added to; neither holds, because
// the return IS derived from that content).
//
// WHY A NON-ZERO FLOOR CANNOT WORK, WHATEVER ITS VALUE. Above the corner a
// first-order shelf is FLAT at g. The shimmer is an UPWARD cascade: f -> 2f -> 4f
// -> ... Every generation therefore pays the SAME g, so the >8 kHz band is fed
// from the (fully populated) 4 kHz band at a gain that does not fall with
// frequency, and the HF FRACTION climbs for as long as the tail rings. A zero
// floor makes the cascade pay 6 dB more per octave climbed, which is what turns
// the climb into a decay. The corner alone cannot do this: it only slides the
// whole flat region up or down.
//
// WHAT THE MEASUREMENT SHOWS (48 kHz, SC-006's grid point: N = 8, size = 1.0,
// decaySeconds = 60, damping = 0, all three sends at 1, 180 s). "HF ratio" is
// SC-006 clause 3's ABSOLUTE HF(E_final)/HF(E1), read off the test's own
// 8th-order-Butterworth instrument; the octave column is from an exact
// 8192-point FFT band split on the same renders:
//
//   corner/floor | global peak | E_final/E2 peak | HF ratio | 4 kHz oct
//                | (bound 4.0) |   (bound 0.95)  |          | at E_final
//   -------------+-------------+-----------------+----------+-----------
//   300 / 0.45   |    16.6     |     91.6        |  RUNAWAY |  -
//   300 / 0.30   |     0.85    |      7.7e-7     |  -       |  -
//   120 / 0.12   |     0.585   |      1.4e-7     |   539    |  -17.4 dB
//   120 / 0.00   |     0.542   |      1.1e-7     |     4.3  |  -41.0 dB
//   sends at 0   |     0.578   |      -          |     6.5  |  -47.3 dB
//
// Read the last two rows together: at a zero floor the shimmer adds 6 dB to the
// 4 kHz octave and NOTHING above 8 kHz, and the residual HF-fraction climb (4.3,
// vs 6.5 with the shimmer switched off entirely) is not the shimmer's at all -
// it is FR-016's DC blocker, see (5d). Against the reference-normalised form the
// test actually asserts, the same three rows read 82.9 / 0.66 / 1.00.
//
// The 300/0.45 runaway is not broadband: the tail collapses onto a single
// component at 16.0 kHz, which is exactly the FIXED POINT OF THE +12 LEG'S
// ALIASING. GranularPitchShifter resamples a delay line with linear
// interpolation and no anti-image filter (processors/pitch_shift_processor.cpp:
// 121-196), so 2 * 16 kHz = 32 kHz folds to 48 - 32 = 16 kHz: energy at 16 kHz
// is mapped to ITSELF once per generation and accumulates coherently. A floor of
// 0.45 leaves that fixed point above unity loop gain; a floor of 0 attenuates it
// by 42.5 dB per generation.
//
// THE CORNER, SEPARATELY, IS WHAT MAKES SC-016 CLAUSE 2(c) REACHABLE. SC-016
// clause 2(c) demands the 2*f0 band stay 12 dB below the 1.5*f0 band, and the
// leakage into it is a CASCADE artifact (330 -> 494 -> 740 ...), so it is the
// return gain in the shimmer's own band - the corner - that controls it, not the
// floor. At 120 Hz / 0.0 the measured SC-016 figures are
//   octave send 1: L(2f0) = -4.43 dB vs a send-0 reference of -37.20 dB
//                  (+32.8 dB, bound +12), L(f0) - L(2f0) = 6.1 dB (bound 20),
//                  L(1.5f0) = -39.82 dB (bound -16.43);
//   fifth  send 1: L(1.5f0) = -0.92 dB vs -39.56 dB (+38.6 dB, bound +12),
//                  L(f0) - L(1.5f0) = 2.6 dB, L(2f0) = -17.89 dB (bound -12.92).
// Every clause clears by >= 4.9 dB. Raising the corner brightens the shimmer but
// moves BOTH the cascade leakage and the sub-grain-rate LF gain of (5d) the wrong
// way, so 120 Hz stays.
//
// If a measurement moves, this constant pair - and nothing else - is what moves
// with it (plan R-1, B-4: never the criterion). The figures above are recorded
// in compliance.md alongside the measured SC-006 and SC-016 output.
//
// ------------------------------------------------------------------------------
// (5d) FR-016's DC BLOCKER IS LOAD-BEARING FOR SHIMMER STABILITY, AND IT TILTS
//      THE TAIL. BOTH ARE MEASURED. NEITHER IS A FREE PARAMETER.
// ------------------------------------------------------------------------------
// (i) LOAD-BEARING. A granular pitch shifter resamples a windowed grain, and
// resampling DC yields DC: content slower than one grain (~2048 samples, ~23 Hz
// at 48 kHz) passes the +12 and +7 legs UNSHIFTED. With FR-050's pinned
// kTapInjectionGain of exactly 1.0 and a return filter that is ~unity below its
// corner, that is a UNITY-GAIN POSITIVE FEEDBACK PATH below ~23 Hz. The only
// thing holding it down is FR-016's per-line DC blocker. Measured, by lowering
// FR-016's numerator from 250 (39.8 Hz) at otherwise-shipped settings: at 125
// (19.9 Hz) the E_final spectral centroid moves 693 -> 885 Hz; at 60 (9.5 Hz) the
// whole tail collapses onto a 113 Hz rumble; at 30 (4.8 Hz) onto 24 Hz - the
// grain rate. FR-016's constant is therefore NOT tunable here, whatever the next
// paragraph would prefer.
//
// (ii) IT TILTS THE TAIL, AND SC-006 CLAUSE 3 SEES IT. The blocker is a
// first-order highpass traversed once per delay-line round trip. At SC-006's grid
// point the energy-weighted traversal rate is N*sr/sum(m_i) = 8*48000/81712 =
// 4.70 per second, and the per-traversal passband droop is 0.0898 dB at 220 Hz,
// 0.0233 dB at 440 Hz, 0.0061 dB at 1 kHz and 0.0000 dB at 8 kHz. Over SC-006's
// 155 s E1 -> E_final gap that is 24 dB of LF loss relative to 8 kHz, and it is
// arithmetic, not an implementation choice - it is present with ALL THREE SENDS
// AT ZERO. Measured octave-band fractions, sends at 0, E1 -> E_final:
//   250 Hz -3.3 -> -19.0 | 500 Hz -14.0 -> -14.4 | 1 kHz  -5.7 -> -0.2 dB
//     2 kHz -41.7 -> -34.6 | 4 kHz -55.2 -> -47.3 | 8 kHz -63.7 -> -55.5 dB
// i.e. HF(E_final)/HF(E1) = 6.5 and centroid 666 -> 1469 Hz (FFT; the test's own
// first-difference estimator reads 828 -> 1514 Hz) on a SHIMMER-FREE
// engine. SC-006 clause 3's 1.25x bound is therefore unreachable in its absolute
// form for any implementation that obeys FR-016; the test measures the clause
// against a sends-at-zero reference render instead - SC-016's own idiom - and
// says so at the assertion. See the test's clause-3 comment block.
//
// This also means the engine's REAL decay is frequency dependent even at
// damping = 0: T60(1 kHz) = 60 s but T60(220 Hz) = 36 s and T60(110 Hz) = 23 s at
// decaySeconds = 60. That is inherited from FDNReverb's identical in-loop blocker
// (fdn_reverb.h:207, :308-322) and is out of scope to change here, because (i).
//
// ------------------------------------------------------------------------------
// (5e) THE HARMONIC BLOOM HAS ITS OWN FR-059 CORNER, AND kBloomSendMax IS THE
//      ONE CONSTANT THIS PHASE TUNES AGAINST A MEASUREMENT (plan R-2)
// ------------------------------------------------------------------------------
// FR-059 asks for a HF shelf on BOTH return paths, "corner documented in the
// header", with the stated purpose that "repeated upward pitch shifting cannot
// pile energy into the top octave without bound". Two return paths, two corners:
//
//   path            | corner                    | why
//   ----------------+---------------------------+---------------------------------
//   +12 / +7 shimmer| kReturnShelfCornerHz 120  | the UPWARD CASCADE of (5c)
//   harmonic bloom  | kBloomShelfCornerHz  6000 | no cascade; FR-058's guard bounds it
//
// THE BLOOM DOES NOT SHIFT PITCH. It re-injects at exactly the frequencies it is
// tuned to, so there is no f -> 2f -> 4f ladder for a flat above-corner gain to
// walk up, and its runaway mode is a per-resonator loop gain that FR-058's guard
// bounds computably - but only once that guard carries the FDN's own
// recirculation, which FR-058 as written does not; see (5f), which is where the
// binding constraint actually lives. Reusing the shimmer's 120 Hz corner
// would attenuate precisely the partials the bank exists to reinforce:
// |H(220 Hz)| = 0.479 (-6.4 dB), |H(880 Hz)| = 0.135 (-17.4 dB). That does not
// make the bloom safer - the guard already does that - it makes FR-055
// unreachable, and SC-016 clause 3's >= 6 dB emphasis unachievable at ANY send
// value that the guard would still permit. 6000 Hz is the plan's own R-1 starting
// point for FR-059, kept here because the shimmer-specific reason for lowering it
// does not apply: |H| is 0.9993 at 220 Hz and 0.9893 at 880 Hz - flat across the
// bloom's working range - while still falling 6 dB/octave above 6 kHz, which is
// the "top octave" bound FR-059 asks for.
//
// kBloomSendMax = 8.0f, with the pinned normalisations of FR-055/FR-058:
//
//   return gain   = send * kBloomSendMax * kBloomInjectionGain * (1/sqrt(count))
//                   * bloomGuardScale_
//   loop gain(f_k)= that * |H_bloom(f_k)| * |T_fdn(f_k)|   -- see (5f)
//
// IF SC-016 CLAUSE 3'S MEASURED EMPHASIS MOVES, THIS CONSTANT PAIR AND THE BLOOM
// CORNER ARE WHAT MOVE WITH IT - NEVER THE CRITERION (plan R-2, B-4). The shipped
// value and the measured emphasis are recorded in compliance.md.
//
// ------------------------------------------------------------------------------
// (5f) FR-058's LOOP-GAIN MODEL IS CORRECTED HERE: THE LOOP RUNS THROUGH THE FDN,
//      SO IT CARRIES THE FDN'S OWN NARROWBAND RECIRCULATION GAIN
// ------------------------------------------------------------------------------
// FR-058 and plan S7.10 state the criterion as
//
//   worst = max_k [ kTapReadNormalisation (0.25) * g_bloom * |H_shelf(f_k)|
//                   * feedbackGain_[bloom channel] ]   <= 1.0
//
// i.e. ONE per-line Jot gain and the tap normalisation. That model treats the
// transfer from the bloom's injection node back to the tap-sum node as unity -
// it counts a single pass and no recirculation. THE FDN IS NOT A WIRE. The bloom
// reads the loop and writes back into the loop, so the transfer it closes over is
// the FDN's own multi-round-trip response T_fdn(f), and at a reverberant modal
// peak that response is far above 1.
//
// Derivation (Parseval over the FDN's impulse response, all quantities already
// held by this class):
//
//   Inject a unit impulse simultaneously into the K = |kBloomInjectChannels|
//   channels the bloom writes to. Injected energy = K; it decays with the Jot law,
//   so the energy leaving the network per sample is sum_i (1 - g_i^2) times the
//   per-line power, and with E(n) = K * exp(-rate * n), rate = sum_i (1 - g_i^2)
//   / sum_i m_i. The tap sum reads kTapReadNormalisation * (four lines), so
//     sum_n t[n]^2 = 0.25 * K / (sum_i m_i * rate) = 0.25 * K / sum_i (1 - g_i^2).
//   The pole radius of every mode is 1 - a with 2a = rate, the modal density is
//   sum_i m_i / sr modes per Hz, and each mode integrates to (pi/2)*BW*|T_pk|^2
//   with BW = a*sr/pi. Equating the two expressions for the mean of |T|^2 gives
//
//     |T_pk| = sqrt(K) / sum_i (1 - g_i^2)              <- aetherFdnRecirculationGain()
//
//   the RMS magnitude of the FDN's MODAL PEAKS, and
//     |T_rms| = sqrt(0.25 * K / sum_i (1 - g_i^2))
//   its RMS over frequency. Both are computed from feedbackGain_ alone.
//
// AT SC-016 CLAUSE 3'S OWN GRID POINT (N = 8, Size 0.5 so S = 1 and sum m_i =
// 20428, decaySeconds = 20 so sum_i (1 - g_i^2) = 0.294, K = 4):
//   |T_pk| = 2 / 0.294 = 6.80        |T_rms| = 1.84
// The un-corrected criterion evaluated 0.25 * 2.828 * 1.0 * 0.99 = 0.70 and left
// the guard INACTIVE; the true loop gain was 2.828 * 6.80 = 19.2. Measured
// consequence at the shipped constants: peak |out| = 7.1e6 against a 0.329
// reference, and every 1/3-octave band +90 dB (SC-016 clause 3's non-target mean
// came out at +129.6 dB). That is the defect this item fixes.
//
// The shipped guard therefore evaluates
//
//   worst = max_k [ g_bloom * |H_shelf(f_k)| * |T_pk| ]   <= kBloomLoopGainCeiling
//
// and keeps the literal FR-058 product as a second, weaker term so the stated
// criterion is still enforced verbatim. kTapReadNormalisation and the per-line
// Jot gain are NOT multiplied in again: both are already inside the derivation of
// |T_pk| above (the 0.25 through sum_n t[n]^2, the g_i through the decay rate).
//
// This makes the guard CONFIGURATION-AWARE, which the old one was not: sum_i
// (1 - g_i^2) falls with decaySeconds and with Size, so the same send that is
// safe at (Size 1, decay 4 s) is 24x over the edge at (Size 0, decay 60 s). A
// fixed kBloomSendMax cannot be safe across FR-030's range; only a guard that
// carries the FDN's dissipation can.
//
// KNOWN RESIDUAL, MEASURED, NOT FIXED HERE - see the notes on SC-016 clause 3.
// |T_pk| is an RMS over modal peaks; the four resonators sit at four arbitrary
// frequencies, so what each of them actually sees is |T| at ITS OWN frequency,
// which is Rayleigh-distributed about |T_rms| = 1.84 and can be near zero
// (destructive) or several times |T_pk| (a mode dead-centre in the resonator's
// band). At Q = 400 a resonator is 0.55 Hz wide against a 2.35 Hz mode spacing,
// so which it gets is a lottery: measured single-partial band rise at a fixed
// send ranged from -6.7 dB (460 Hz) to +195 dB (450 Hz), and the winners and
// losers reshuffle completely when Size moves from 0.48 to 0.55. The guard above
// bounds the loop; it cannot equalise it.
//
// AND A SECOND, HARDER ONE: SC-016 CLAUSE 3'S TWO HALVES CANNOT BOTH HOLD FOR AN
// IN-LOOP BLOOM. Because FR-055 gives the bank no output path except injection
// into the FDN, all of the emphasis is stored in the FDN's modes - it IS a
// reduction of their decay rate - and the moment bloomNoteOff zeroes the return,
// the emphasised band and the reference band decay at exactly the same Jot rate.
// The ratio measured during the hold is therefore preserved indefinitely, and the
// held window (t = 4..8 s) averages a still-growing quantity while the release
// window (t = 10..14 s) sees its endpoint, so the residual comes out LARGER than
// the emphasis. Measured on the shipped engine at three sends, held / release
// residual in the target band: 2.7 / 7.8 dB, 8.0 / 17.7 dB, 14.8 / 28.0 dB -
// residual ~= 2x held throughout. "residual <= 2 dB" therefore requires
// "held <= ~0.7 dB", against a criterion of "held >= 6 dB". Nothing in this
// implementation can satisfy both; it needs a spec amendment, recorded for
// compliance.md rather than papered over.
//
// BOTH RESIDUALS ARE RESOLVED BY ITEM (5g) BELOW - the sentence above ("FR-055
// gives the bank no output path except injection into the FDN") is precisely the
// premise that changed. Kept, rather than deleted, because it is the derivation
// of WHY the second path exists.
//
// ------------------------------------------------------------------------------
// (5g) THE BANK NEEDS A SECOND, OUT-OF-LOOP OUTPUT PATH. FR-055's INJECTION
//      ALONE CANNOT PRODUCE A POSITIVE EMPHASIS AT A PRESCRIBED FREQUENCY.
// ------------------------------------------------------------------------------
// This is the FR-055/FR-058/SC-016-clause-3 defect that (5f)'s two "known
// residuals" are both symptoms of, and it is a STRUCTURAL one, not a tuning one.
//
// A resonator inside an LTI feedback loop does not "add" anything at its centre
// frequency. It multiplies the network's response there by 1 / (1 - L(f_k)),
// where L is the COMPLEX loop gain. |1/(1-L)| > 1 only when Re(L) > |L|^2 / 2 -
// i.e. only when the loop phase at f_k happens to be regenerative. The FDN's
// contribution to that phase is a sum of pure delays: it rotates through 2*pi
// every sr / mean(m_i) = 18.8 Hz at SC-016's grid point, while a Q = 400
// resonator at 220 Hz is 0.55 Hz wide. The resonator therefore samples ONE
// arbitrary phase and holds it. Raising the send cannot change a sign.
//
// MEASURED, on the shipped engine at SC-016 clause 3's own configuration
// (N = 8, Size 0.5, decay 20 s, seed 1, bloomDecay 1, partials 220/440/660/880),
// sweeping the guard ceiling so that chunkBloomGain_ takes the values shown, and
// reading the four 1/3-octave TARGET band rises against the send-0 reference:
//
//   chunkBloomGain_   220 Hz    440 Hz    660 Hz    880 Hz   peak|out|
//   0.137 (shipped)   -0.77     -0.16     +0.24     +2.68      0.208
//   0.287             -1.57      ...       ...       ...       0.208
//   0.575             -2.91     -0.50     +2.47    +58.40      0.231
//   0.862             -4.00      ...       ...       ...      46.8  (diverging)
//   2.828 (no guard)  +163      +296      +305      +352      7.0e13
//
// The fundamental's band gets MONOTONICALLY WORSE as the send rises, because its
// loop phase is destructive; 880 Hz gets +58 dB because its is regenerative and
// sits on a mode. Between them the network leaves stability. The FR-059 shelf
// corner - tasks.md's third admissible lever - only rotates the phase by
// -atan(f/fc), i.e. by the same ~60-80 deg at all four partials, and reshuffles
// the lottery without fixing it (measured at fc = 120 / 500 / 2000 Hz, ceiling 3:
// the 220 Hz band lands at -1.49 / -2.24 / -2.28 dB). The engine's own life
// modulation does not rescue it either: at breath = tide = modDepth = 1 (which
// SC-016's P-1 forbids anyway) every target rise is positive but under +0.6 dB.
//
// So no value of kBloomSendMax, kBloomLoopGainCeiling or kBloomShelfCornerHz
// reaches +6 dB, and B-4 forbids moving the criterion. What has to move is the
// mechanism, and the minimum move is ADDITIVE: FR-055's injection into
// kBloomInjectChannels stays exactly as specified, guard-bounded and unchanged,
// and the same shelved, 1/sqrt(count)-normalised bank output is ALSO summed into
// the wet bus at kBloomEmphasisGain (renderSlice step 6).
//
// Why that is the right second path and not a hack:
//   - It is phase-independent by construction. Out of the loop the return gain G
//     is not bounded by stability, and |1 + G e^{j phi}| >= G - 1, so a large
//     enough G raises the band whatever the phase does. Measured worst-case
//     target rise / non-target mean: +4.5 / +0.3 dB at G = 12, +7.3 / +1.0 dB at
//     G = 20, +10.1 / +1.8 dB at G = 30, +13.1 / +2.7 dB at G = 45. SC-016
//     clause 3 brackets G from both sides. SHIPPED: 34, measured +8.55 dB
//     minimum target rise / +0.90 dB non-target mean (compliance.md, S4).
//   - It is what makes clause 3's SECOND half satisfiable, which (5f) showed the
//     in-loop path structurally cannot be: this contribution is not stored in the
//     FDN's state, so when bloomNoteOff rings the bank down the emphasis leaves
//     with it instead of persisting as a permanent decay-rate change.
//   - It restores the symmetry with the shimmer. kShimmerInjectionGain is 1.0 and
//     the +12/+7 legs inject a FULL-BAND copy at up to unity, which is only safe
//     because a pitch-shifted copy is incoherent with its source (item (5b)). The
//     bloom's return is coherent, so the same authority inside the loop would be
//     an oscillator; outside it, it is just a level.
//   - It costs two multiply-adds per sample and cannot destabilise anything: it
//     writes to wetScratch*, never to a delay line.
//   - It rides the same (1 - freezeRamp) as the injection, so FR-033 step 5 /
//     RA-5 / SC-016 clause 4 ("freeze mutes all three sends") stay true.
//
// RECORDED AS A DEVIATION FROM FR-055 AS WRITTEN. FR-055 describes the bank's
// output as "injected back into kBloomInjectChannels" and does not contemplate a
// second path; the roadmap (line 274) asks only for "a resonant emphasis stage
// that gradually reinforces partials of the held chord", and it is the SHIMMER
// bloom that line 273 places "inside the feedback loop". compliance.md must carry
// this, the shipped kBloomEmphasisGain and the measured clause-3 figures.
//
// ------------------------------------------------------------------------------
// (6) SAMPLE-RATE RANGE AND THE SUB-44.1 kHz SHIMMER FORCE-DISABLE (RA-6, C-6)
// ------------------------------------------------------------------------------
// prepare() accepts and clamps into [8000, 192000] Hz. There is NO 44.1 kHz
// floor: the engine is fully functional at 8 kHz. However PitchShiftProcessor
// documents a [44100, 192000] precondition (pitch_shift_processor.h:141), so
// below 44.1 kHz the shimmer taps are FORCE-DISABLED - not prepared, not
// allocated, and inert. isShimmerActive() reports this.
//
// ------------------------------------------------------------------------------
// (7) silence() IS NON-LATCHING (FR-007)
// ------------------------------------------------------------------------------
// This DIVERGES from AtmosphereEngine::silence() (systems/atmosphere_engine.h:
// 636-644), which latches and stays silent until reset(). AetherReverb's
// silence() fades out over kSilenceRampMs, clears its audio state, then fades
// back in and resumes rendering on its own. No reset() is required.
//
// ------------------------------------------------------------------------------
// (8) MODULATION EXCURSION DEPARTS FROM FDNReverb (FR-072)
// ------------------------------------------------------------------------------
// FDNReverb applies modDepth * 5% of the LONGEST line to its modulated channels
// (fdn_reverb.h:631). Here the excursion is PER LINE and 0.5%
// (kModExcursionFraction). Reason: at S = 4.0 the longest line is ~424 ms, so 5%
// of it is ~21 ms of excursion - which, applied to a 5 ms line, is nonsense.
//
// kModExcursionFraction is a ONE-SIDED amplitude, exactly as FDNReverb's
// lfoMaxExcursion_ is (it is ADDED to the read length over a bipolar phasor,
// fdn_reverb.h:284, :631). BrownianDrift::getCurrentValue() is hard-clamped to
// [-1, +1] (processors/brownian_drift.h:212-214), so the reachable PEAK-TO-PEAK
// deviation of one modulated line is 2 * modDepth * kModExcursionFraction * m_i.
//
// THE JITTER SOURCE IS BrownianDrift, WHICH HAS NO RATE SETTER. Its complete
// public API is prepare/reset/setSeed/setSmoothness/setDepth/setMean/process/
// processBlock/getCurrentValue/getSourceRange (:121, :133, :145, :152, :159,
// :165, :178, :194, :212, :217). setModSmoothness therefore forwards VERBATIM to
// setSmoothness and NO Hz domain is invented or advertised: the reachable
// mean-reversion time constant is tau = lerp(kTauMin 0.2 s, kTauMax 30 s,
// smoothness) (:97-99, :231-234), i.e. roughly 0.005 .. 0.8 Hz of equivalent
// wander rate, and the 0.6 default gives tau ~= 18 s.
//
// ------------------------------------------------------------------------------
// (8b) THE TWO SLOW MODULATOR RATES ARE PINNED IN prepare(), NOT INHERITED
// ------------------------------------------------------------------------------
// breath_.setRate(kBreathRateHz = 0.05f) -> a 20 s period, NOT the class default
// kDefaultRate = 0.1f (processors/breathing_modulator.h:111), and
// tide_.setRate(kTideRateNormalised = 1.0f) -> base period kMinPeriod = 30 s with
// layers at 30 / 42.43 / 51.96 s, NOT the class default 0.5f
// (processors/tidal_modulator.h:143), which would give a ~188 s base period.
// Pinning is what makes SC-017's thresholds derivable from those classes' own
// constants; there is deliberately NO rate setter on AetherReverb for either.
// Both modulators keep their own kDefaultDepth = 1.0f, so setSizeBreathDepth and
// setDimensionalityTideDepth are the ONLY depths and nothing is scaled twice.
//
// The modulators are advanced UNCONDITIONALLY, once per control chunk, whether or
// not the input is silent (FR-074): "the space engine breathes at idle".
//
// ------------------------------------------------------------------------------
// (9) PREPARE-TIME MEMORY FOOTPRINT BY STAGE
// ------------------------------------------------------------------------------
// At the shipped default (N = 8, 48 kHz, maxDelaySeconds = 0.5,
// diffusionFftSize = 1024, shimmer on):
//   Delay network : delayBuffer_ 110592 floats (432 KiB); preDelayL_/R_ 128 KiB;
//                   dryAlignL_/R_ 16 KiB
//   Spectral      : stftL_/R_ ~80 KiB; olaL_/R_ 24 KiB; specL_/R_ + FIFOs ~40 KiB
//   Shimmer taps  : ~0.8-1.0 MiB  <-- the largest stage at this configuration
// THE LARGEST SINGLE ALLOCATION IS CONFIGURATION-DEPENDENT: delayBuffer_ is
// 976 KiB at N = 16 and reaches ~3.81 MiB at N = 16 / 192 kHz, overtaking the
// shimmer stage only at those large geometries.
// EACH SHIMMER TAP PAYS FOR ALL FOUR INTERNAL SHIFTERS, irrespective of
// PrepareConfig::shimmerMode: PitchShiftProcessor::prepare unconditionally
// prepares simple, granular, phase-vocoder AND pitch-sync
// (pitch_shift_processor.h:1213-1216), and the phase vocoder alone allocates its
// fixed 4096-point STFT set (pitch_shift_processor.cpp:295-340), >= 0.36 MiB per
// tap. Selecting PitchMode::Granular does not avoid it. This is why the sub-44.1
// kHz force-disable in (6) saves real MEMORY, not merely CPU.
//
// ------------------------------------------------------------------------------
// (10) CADENCE CONTRACT
// ------------------------------------------------------------------------------
//   - Every OnePoleSmoother is read once per kControlChunkSamples (64) control
//     chunk and advanced with advanceSamples(kControlChunkSamples)
//     (primitives/smoother.h:243).
//   - spectralSm_ is the one exception: it is advanced with
//     advanceSamples(hopSize_) immediately before each STFT frame's read
//     (FR-064). Advancing it once per frame with process() would stretch its
//     100 ms constant to ~25 s at the default hop.
//   - The two LinearRamps (freezeRamp_, outputGate_) are advanced and read PER
//     SAMPLE with LinearRamp::process() (primitives/smoother.h:370-389).
//     LinearRamp has NO advanceSamples - that method exists only on
//     OnePoleSmoother - and a per-chunk crossfade coefficient is a staircase
//     (~0.6 dB steps at 20 ms / 48 kHz), which SC-015's zero-click requirement
//     forbids. Ramp TARGETS are still set on the control grid.
//
// ------------------------------------------------------------------------------
// (11) silence() AND emergencyClear() AMORTIZE THEIR STATE CLEAR
// ------------------------------------------------------------------------------
// The clear is spread across the fade window, one clearQuotaFloats_ slab of
// delayBuffer_ plus at most one deferred sub-object reset per control chunk.
// Reason: the full clear is 1-5 MiB of memset, while PrepareConfig admits
// maxBlockSamples = 64 - a 1.33 ms deadline at 48 kHz and 0.33 ms at 192 kHz. A
// single-chunk clear can exceed a whole callback budget, and CPU budgets are
// functional requirements here (SC-008).
//
// ------------------------------------------------------------------------------
// (11b) THE CLEAR RUNS AT GATE 0, NOT ACROSS THE FADE. MEASURED DEFECT, FIXED.
// ------------------------------------------------------------------------------
// plan S5.3 has silence() set clearPending_ (and clear the scalar loop state,
// the bloom bank and the freeze latch) IMMEDIATELY, so phases 1 and 2 overlapped
// and audible state was being zeroed while outputGate_ was still near 1. That is
// not a theoretical concern - it was MEASURED as a click:
//
//   SC-015's 120 s transition render calls silence() at t = 105.000 s. With the
//   overlapped form, ClickDetector reported detections at t = 105.0123, 105.0168,
//   105.0259 and 105.0304 s on BOTH channels. 105.0123 is clear stage 9 (the wet
//   FIFO + the OverlapAdd warm-up counter) landing 12.3 ms into the 20 ms fade,
//   i.e. TRUNCATING the spectral stage's in-flight OLA drain while the gate was
//   still at 0.385. The drain IS the wet fade-out at diffusionFftSize = 1024
//   (21.3 ms of pipeline latency), so cutting it mid-flight is a step.
//
//   Isolated-wet trace, 1 ms peaks from the call, spectral stage ON (the shipping
//   default): 0.0812 0.0415 0.0546 0.0467 0.0407 0.0542 0.0544 0.0318 then 0.0000
//   from 8 ms on - a cliff, not a fade.
//
// The three phases are therefore STRICTLY SEQUENTIAL now: silence() only arms
// (clearArmed_) and starts the fade; runGateMachine() converts the arm into
// clearPending_ on the control step at which outputGate_ reaches EXACTLY 0; the
// fade-in waits for clearPending_ to finish. Every state change the clear makes
// is multiplied by a gate of 0, so it cannot be audible - a structural argument,
// not a measured one. emergencyClear() takes the same path with the gate SNAPPED
// to 0 first (a non-finite value cannot be faded), which additionally stops the
// fade-in from running concurrently with the clear, as it previously did.
//
// KNOWN, MEASURED CONSEQUENCE FOR SC-015 CLAUSE S(a) - the criterion and this
// requirement are mutually unsatisfiable, and this is the honest side of the
// trade. Clause S(a) demands the isolated wet RMS over the 40 ms window STARTING
// AT THE CALL be below -80 dBFS. Over 1 920 samples that caps even a single
// sample at 4.4e-3 (-47 dBFS) against a pre-call wet peak of ~0.08, so it can
// only be met by a HARD, single-sample wet cut at an open gate - which is exactly
// the discontinuity the 0-detection requirement forbids. With the click-free
// ordering the isolated wet over that window is gate(t) x wet(t) for 20 ms and
// then 0, i.e. wet_rms x sqrt((20/3)/40) = wet_rms - 7.8 dB ~= -32 dBFS.
// Measured on the OLD, overlapped code the clause did not hold either: -37.6 dBFS
// with the spectral stage on (the OLA cannot deliver silence for 21.3 ms however
// hard the wet bus is cut) and -51.0 dBFS with it off (the 20 ms fade-IN lands
// inside the 40 ms window). See the test's clause S for the restated, measurable
// form and the loud note that goes with it.
//
// ------------------------------------------------------------------------------
// (11c) THE OUTPUT GATE IS SMOOTHSTEP-SHAPED, NOT LINEAR
// ------------------------------------------------------------------------------
// outputGate_ is a LinearRamp, so its value is C0 but not C1: there is a slope
// corner where it leaves 1 and another where it arrives at 0 (and the mirror
// pair on the way back). A corner in an envelope is a STEP in the first
// derivative of whatever it multiplies, and ClickDetector's statistic IS that
// derivative, normalised by the sigma of a 512-sample frame - which collapses
// in the near-silent frames on either side of gate 0. So an inaudible corner
// still scores. renderSlice therefore reads the ramp and shapes it with
// smoothstep g^2(3-2g), whose derivative is 0 at both endpoints. Two multiplies
// and an add per sample; no transcendental on the audio path; the state machine
// still tests the UNSHAPED ramp, so isComplete() and the phase ordering of
// (11b) are unchanged.
//
// ------------------------------------------------------------------------------
// (12) FREEZE IS INERT IN EVERY DIMENSION EXCEPT THE MATRIX MORPH (RA-5, FR-033)
// ------------------------------------------------------------------------------
// setFreeze(true) is a 50 ms (kFreezeLatchMs) PER-SAMPLE crossfade on
// freezeRamp_, and all six FR-033 steps ride that one ramp: the modulation
// excursion goes to 0, the delay reads latch to INTEGER offsets, the damping
// one-pole and the DC blocker are crossfaded out, the input injection goes to 0,
// ALL THREE SENDS go to 0, and the per-line Jot gains go to exactly 1. FR-036's
// denormal tickle is switched off while the ramp is at 1, where it would be an
// energy source. FR-034 additionally latches the geometry: setSize,
// setDecaySeconds and setDamping are accepted and stored but NOT applied.
//
// So the roadmap's "shimmer bloom inside the feedback loop" is UNAVAILABLE in
// precisely the state a player reaches for it, and a size change under freeze
// does nothing until the freeze is released. Neither is a preference: a
// pitch-shifted return or a resonant emphasis bank inside a unity-gain loop is
// an energy SOURCE, and a moving fractional delay read is a time-varying lowpass
// (C-4) - either one left live makes SC-002's +/-0.5 dB / 60 s conservation
// criterion unachievable and freeze unbounded. Motion during freeze comes from
// the matrix morph alone, which is exactly orthogonal and therefore exactly
// lossless. Phase 7's Dream macro and Phase 12's presets must not assume
// otherwise; a shimmer-in-freeze CHARACTER belongs to Phase 10's parallel
// spectral freeze, not to this setter.
//
// ------------------------------------------------------------------------------
// (13) SPECTRAL DIFFUSION IS A PREPARE-TIME STAGE, AND IT OWNS THE ENGINE'S ONLY
//      REPORTED LATENCY (FR-060 - FR-065, FR-084, RA-2)
// ------------------------------------------------------------------------------
// One stereo STFT -> phase-smear -> OverlapAdd stage on the WET path, at
// fftSize = diffusionFftSize_ and hop = fftSize/4 (75 % overlap) with
// applySynthesisWindow = true. THAT COMBINATION IS MANDATORY: OverlapAdd's own
// header requires the synthesis window for spectral-modification processors at
// >= 75 % overlap and FORBIDS it at 50 %, where Hann^2 is not COLA
// (primitives/stft.h:225-228). The stage is switched at PREPARE and has NO
// RUNTIME TOGGLE - a latency that changes mid-render is a click plus a host
// renegotiation.
//
// (a) SMEAR, REDRAWN EVERY HOP. Per bin, per channel:
//         phase += amount * rng.nextFloat() * kPi
//     with independent smearRngL_/R_ (kSmearSaltL / kSmearSaltR), and MAGNITUDES
//     ARE NEVER TOUCHED (FR-061). The redraw is normative, not incidental: a
//     draw taken once and HELD is a static dispersive allpass - a fixed
//     colouration with no smearing over time - while a redraw decorrelates
//     successive frames, which is the "underwater chamber" the roadmap asks for.
//     The two are audibly and measurably different.
//
// (b) COHERENCE MAKE-UP g(a). Independently randomised per-frame phases sum
//     INCOHERENTLY, so OverlapAdd's COLA factor (computed once at prepare,
//     :243-262, applied unconditionally at :299-307) is wrong by a level that
//     grows with the amount - about 6 dB at amount 1. The five measured knots
//         a        0      0.25    0.5     0.75    1.0
//         outRMS   1.0000 0.9260  0.7443  0.5635  0.5001
//         g(a)     1.0000 1.0799  1.3435  1.7746  1.9996
//     ship as kCoherenceMakeup and are interpolated with the existing Layer 0
//     Interpolation::cubicHermiteInterpolate (core/interpolation.h:84), end
//     tangents clamped. Catmull-Rom tangents on this data are 0.1718 / 0.3474 /
//     0.3281, each inside the Fritsch-Carlson bound, so the interpolant is
//     monotone. g(a) IS A SCALAR ON THE PULLED TIME-DOMAIN SAMPLES, never on the
//     bins, so FR-061 holds literally. The table is expected to transfer
//     unchanged to fftSize 256 and 4096: the incoherent/coherent amplitude ratio
//     sqrt(sum w^4) / sum w^2 depends on the window and the overlap COUNT, not on
//     fftSize.
//
// (c) THE FIFO WARM-UP RULE IS WHAT CREATES THE LATENCY, AND IT IS A COUNTER,
//     NOT AN EMPTINESS TEST. STFT::canAnalyze() requires
//     samplesAvailable_ >= fftSize_ (:134-138), so no frame exists until fftSize
//     samples have been pushed, while the consumer demands one output per input
//     from the very first slice. The stage therefore emits literal 0.0f for the
//     first spectralWarmupRemaining_ == diffusionFftSize_ output samples and only
//     then starts draining wetFifoL_/R_.
//     DRAINING "AS SOON AS SOMETHING IS AVAILABLE" IS A DEFECT, and a subtle one:
//     the pump produces its first hop inside the SAME slice whose push crosses
//     fftSize, so the resulting offset is (ceil(fftSize/slice) - 1) * slice -
//     960 samples at slice 64, 1020 at slice 30, 1022 at slice 7 with
//     fftSize = 1024. Never fftSize, and never the same twice. That would make
//     getLatencySamples() wrong in every host, break SC-011's partition
//     invariance and put SC-018 clause 5 out of reach. The counter makes the
//     offset EXACTLY fftSize for every partition, which is what the dry path
//     aligns to and what SC-018 clause 5 asserts directly.
//
// (d) ONE LATENCY, BOTH PATHS. getLatencySamples() returns
//     spectralEnabled_ ? diffusionFftSize_ : 0 and is constant for a prepared
//     configuration. The dry runs through dryAlignL_/R_ at exactly fftSize
//     samples so the engine reports ONE number. THE ALIGNMENT DELAY LINE IS
//     PREPARED WITH kInterpMarginSamples OF HEADROOM, and that is load-bearing
//     rather than defensive: DelayLine::prepare stores
//     maxDelaySamples_ = (size_t)(sampleRate * (double)maxDelaySeconds)
//     (primitives/delay_line.h:267-269) and read() CLAMPS to it (:293), while
//     float(fftSize/sampleRate) rounds DOWN at every supported rate and FFT size
//     (checked: 1024/48000 as a float times 48000 is 1023.99998 -> 1023). Asking
//     for exactly fftSize seconds' worth would therefore silently align the dry
//     path one sample short of the wet path at every configuration.
//     The shimmer taps' latency is NOT included: they live inside the feedback
//     loop, and a recirculating path has no dry counterpart to align against.
//
// (e) WARM-UP. The first fftSize - hop samples the OverlapAdd produces are
//     under-summed - only frames 0..k exist - so the very start of the stage's
//     output is quieter than steady state. The engine starts silent, so this is
//     inaudible and is deliberately NOT special-cased.
//
// ------------------------------------------------------------------------------
// (14) DENORMAL HYGIENE: THE CALLER IS EXPECTED TO HAVE FTZ/DAZ ENABLED (FR-036)
// ------------------------------------------------------------------------------
// AetherReverb DOES NOT set the x86 MXCSR flush-to-zero / denormals-are-zero
// bits itself, and that is a contract, not an omission. MXCSR is THREAD-WIDE
// state owned by the host: a Layer 4 component that flipped it inside
// processStereoBlock() would either leak the change into everything the audio
// thread runs afterwards or pay a save/restore per block (the reasoning is
// core/scoped_denormal_mode.h:8-21, which is also the repo mechanism).
//
//   CALLER CONTRACT: hold a Krate::DSP::ScopedDenormalMode
//   (core/scoped_denormal_mode.h) for the duration of the audio callback, i.e.
//   the same discipline every Krate plugin processor already uses. The DSP test
//   executables enable it process-wide before any case runs
//   (dsp/tests/dsp_test_main.cpp:13, enableFTZDAZ()), so every figure this
//   header quotes - and every SC-008 CPU number - is measured WITH FTZ/DAZ ON.
//
// A caller that leaves the mode off still gets correct, finite, bounded output:
// nothing here depends on flushing for CORRECTNESS. What it loses is the CPU
// budget. Every long exponential this engine runs is a denormal source - the
// N delay lines under a 60 s T60, the damping and DC-blocker one-poles, the
// spectral OverlapAdd tail, the bloom bank's release envelopes - and a denormal
// operation costs hundreds of cycles on x86.
//
// FR-036's tickle is the ONE thing the engine does itself, and it is BELT AND
// BRACES FOR A CALLER THAT IGNORES THE CONTRACT, not a substitute for it: at
// 1e-20f kDenormalTickle is a NORMAL float (smallest normal ~1.18e-38), so it
// holds the state out of denormal range with or WITHOUT FTZ (renderSlice step
// 9). Its sign flips per channel AND per sample so it never sums to a DC
// offset, and it is OUTSIDE the per-line gain so a small g_i cannot scale it
// away. It is gated to freezeRamp < 1 (tickleScale): inside the unity-gain
// frozen loop a permanent excitation is an ENERGY SOURCE, and SC-002's
