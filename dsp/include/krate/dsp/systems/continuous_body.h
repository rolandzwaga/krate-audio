// plate, chamber, ice - driven by a sustained stereo stream rather than struck
// by an impulse. Membrum already models struck bodies; the new DSP work here is
// the continuous-excitation adapter (input RMS tracking -> resonator drive
// compensation, feedback-safe damping floors) so a permanently-driven high-Q
// bank never runs away.

// plugin include, no arch-guarded krate include.
//
// The same-layer include of <krate/dsp/systems/timevar_comb_bank.h> is LEGAL:
// tools/lint-layers.js:74 flags only strictly-upward includes, and
// systems/poly_synth_engine.h:40-41 is the in-tree precedent. timevar_comb_bank.h
// itself includes only Layers 0-1, so no cycle exists.

// CONSTANT SCOPING (FR-008): every named constant below is `static constexpr`
// INSIDE the class, never at namespace scope. That is what lets kMinWidth /
// kMaxWidth / kDefaultWidth coexist with DiffusionNetwork's namespace-scope
// constants of the same name, and kNumCombs with everything else in Krate::DSP.
