// smeared by a per-channel STFT phase-randomisation stage ("blur") and mixed
// against a pure-freeze drone from SpectralFreezeOscillator.
//
// LAYER DISCIPLINE (FR-002). Layer 3 may include Layer 0/1/2 only. This header
//   includes core/, primitives/ and processors/ headers exclusively; never a
//   systems/ or effects/ header. Deliberately ABSENT and not to be re-added:
//     - core/stereo_utils.h      nothing in it is used; its only function is
//                                stereoCrossBlend, a width/ping-pong blend that
//                                cannot decorrelate. There is no width control
//                                here - global width is Phase 7's StereoField.
//     - processors/brownian_drift.h  the OU recurrence is reproduced as SoA
//                                lanes (GrainDriftLanes); no BrownianDrift is
//                                instantiated. harmonic_cloud.h omits it for
//                                the same reason.
//   node tools/lint-layers.js gates this, not inspection.
//
// REAL-TIME SAFETY CONTRACT (FR-003).
//   prepare(double, const PrepareConfig&) is the ONLY method that allocates,
//   and the only method that is not real-time safe. Everything else - reset(),
//   silence(), processStereoBlock(), every setter and every accessor - is
//   noexcept, allocation-free, lock-free and I/O-free. reset() returns the exact
//   post-prepare state without deallocating. setGrainEnvelope() SELECTS one of
//   the six windows prepare() generated (see regenerateEnvelopeBank()) - it is
//   a store, safe to drive from an automation lane at block rate.
//
//   THAT BLOCK-RATE AUTOMATION CONTRACT DOES NOT EXTEND TO triggerGrain()
//   (FR-020). Every other mutator here is a pure STORE of a value the audio
//   thread only reads; triggerGrain() is a READ-MODIFY-WRITE of
//   pendingTriggers_/droppedTriggers_, counters pass A also read-modify-writes.
//   It is therefore AUDIO THREAD ONLY: an off-thread caller is a data race that
//   breaks FR-022's "consumed exactly once". No atomic is introduced because no
//   caller is off-thread - a control-thread caller would need
//   std::atomic<std::uint32_t> with a CAS saturation loop, not a bare increment.
//
// MEMORY (FR-073, plan RA-2). The rolling capture ring dominates: it is stereo
//   float and its capacity is rounded UP to a power of two
//   (rolling_capture_buffer.h:83), so
//       bytes = nextPowerOf2(sampleRate * captureSeconds) * 2 channels * 4 B
//   Per voice, at 48 kHz:
//       captureSeconds  4 s -> 262144 frames ->  2.10 MB
//       captureSeconds  8 s -> 524288 frames ->  4.19 MB   (PrepareConfig default)
//       captureSeconds 16 s -> 1048576 frames -> 8.39 MB
//       captureSeconds 30 s -> 2097152 frames -> 16.8 MB
//   At 96 kHz every figure DOUBLES (30 s -> 33.6 MB per voice). Polyphony
//   multiplies it: 16 voices at 30 s / 48 kHz is 268 MB. The shipped value, and
//   any move to a ring shared between voices, is a Phase 7 decision - the table
//   is carried here so that decision is not taken by surprise.
//
//   The only other non-trivial allocation is the envelope BANK:
//   kEnvelopeTypeCount * kEnvelopeTableSize * 4 B = 98 KiB per voice, 2.3 % of
//   the default ring. It buys the removal of a 4096-entry, two-transcendental-
//   per-entry regeneration from the audio path - see regenerateEnvelopeBank().
//
// OPERATING RULE (FR-022, FR-073).
//       density (grains/s) * grainSeconds <= kMaxGrains
//   is the region in which no trigger is ever skipped for a full pool. The
//   default control table sits at 4 grains/s * 4 s = 16 concurrent grains,
//   well inside it. Past that boundary the engine SKIPS triggers - it never
//   steals a live grain (FR-023) - and getSkippedTriggerCountPoolFull() climbs.
//
// kMaxGrains = 64 IS PROVISIONAL AND MEASUREMENT-BACKED (FR-022), AND IT HAS
//   NOW BEEN MEASURED. FR-022's arithmetic ceiling is
//   106,667 ns / (64 x 512) = 3.255 ns per grain-sample.
//   AtmosphereEngine_GrainSampleCost measures (13th Gen Core i9-13900HX,
//   MSVC Release, best-of-25 x 500 blocks, three consecutive runs):
//       captureSeconds = 30 (16.8 MB ring) : 9.55 .. 9.96 ns  (2.93 .. 3.06 x)
//       captureSeconds =  8 (4.19 MB ring) : 9.38 .. 10.32 ns (2.88 .. 3.17 x)
//   THE MEMORY HYPOTHESIS DID NOT SURVIVE THAT MEASUREMENT: the two ring sizes
//   differ by 4x in bytes and by less than the run-to-run spread in cost, and a
//   probe at captureSeconds = 1 (a 256 KB/channel, L2-resident ring) also
//   measured within noise of the 8 s figure. The cost is instruction-bound, not
//   miss-bound, so there is no cache-shaped saving to find and a smaller pool
//   does not make a grain-sample cheaper - it only makes fewer of them.
//
//   kMaxGrains IS DELIBERATELY LEFT AT 64. SC-004 lever (5) exists to be spent
//   when reducing the pool brings a configuration under budget, and measurement
//   says it does not: four of SC-004's five configurations run at the FR-009
//   default of 16 concurrent grains, where the cap does not bind at all, and the
//   fifth would still land at ~99,900 ns/block at kMaxGrains = 16 - while
//   making the DEFAULT control table permanently pool-saturated. Spending a
//   capability lever that buys no criterion is not "reduce cost". The full
//   measurement, the levers that WERE spent, and the escalation this implies are
//   in the T019 decision record in
//   dsp/tests/unit/systems/atmosphere_engine_perf_test.cpp and in
//   specs/seraphis-phase5-atmosphere/compliance.md.
//
// BLUR LATENCY (plan RA-3). With blurEnabled the whole layer - both crossfade
//   legs, because the freeze leg is delay-matched to the same figure - is
//   latent by exactly blurFftSize (the SNAPPED value), reported by
//   getLatencySamples(). It is constant between prepare() calls and does not
//   move with the blur knob. With blurEnabled = false the latency is 0.
//
// ENVELOPE ENDPOINTS AND THEIR CONDITIONING (FR-027). The forced
//   table entry 0 and the FR-026 phase denominator L'-1 make the FIRST and
//   the LAST emitted sample of EVERY grain exactly 0, for every
//   GrainEnvelopeType and every legal L' >= 2, unconditionally - including
//   Exponential, whose generated tail ends at ~0.0183 rather than 0
//   (grain_envelope.h:144-150).
//
//   FORCING TABLE ENTRIES TO 0 DOES NOT BOUND THE STEP AT THE NEIGHBOURING
//   SAMPLE, AND THAT IS WHAT A CLICK DETECTOR MEASURES. The per-sample
//   table-index step is Delta = (kEnvelopeTableSize - 1) / (L' - 1), and it
//   exceeds 1 whenever L' < kEnvelopeTableSize - i.e. for any REQUESTED grain
//   shorter than 4096/sampleRate (~85 ms at 48 kHz). At the kMinGrainSeconds =
//   0.05 end, L' = 2400 at 48 kHz gives Delta = 1.707: the render STEPS OVER
//   the forced entries, so the sample next to the boundary reads the generated
//   window unchanged. A run of forced ZEROES cannot help here however long it
//   is - lookup interpolates linearly across the run's leading edge, so a
//   rendered sample can still land on the last un-forced value and the very
//   next one on 0. MEASURED with a zero run alone, Exponential at
//   grainSeconds = 0.05 opened on a 1.658 % step and closed on a 1.334 % step
//   of one grain's amplitude, and SC-003's detector resolved it clearly: that
//   cell needed sigma 21.0 to reach a 0 false-positive floor where the five
//   naturally-closing envelopes needed 11.5.
//
//   THE FIX IS A RAMP, NOT A RUN. kEnvelopeEdgeFadeEntries entries at EACH end
//   of the table are multiplied by a linear ramp to 0, so the window value one
//   render step inside the boundary is bounded by v_edge * Delta / F rather
//   than by v_edge. F = 64 against Delta_max = 4095 / (0.05 * 44100 - 1) =
//   1.858 bounds Exponential's edge step at 0.0183 * 1.858 / 64 = 5.3e-4;
//   measured 1.34e-3 opening / 4.2e-4 closing at 48 kHz, and the cell's
//   required sigma fell from 21.0 to 12.5 (see SC-003's TU header for the full
//   measured grid). F costs 64/4096 = 1.56 % of the window at each end, where
//   every naturally-closing type is already below 1e-3.
//
//   The kEnvelopeTailZeroEntries run is RETAINED on top of the ramp for the
//   independent float-rounding reason documented at its declaration.
//   prepare()'s sampleRate > 1.0 floor is a defensive guard against a
//   non-finite control dt, NOT an operating point: below 44.1 kHz the first and
//   last samples are still exactly 0, only the edge-step bound weakens.
//
// Constitution Compliance:
// - Principle II: Real-Time Safety (allocation confined to prepare())
// - Principle III: Modern C++20 (RAII, constexpr, no raw owning pointers)
// - Principle IX: Layer 3 (depends on Layers 0-2 only)
// - Principle XII: Test-First Development
