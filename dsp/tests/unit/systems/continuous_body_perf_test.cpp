// ==============================================================================
// Constitution Principle XII: Test-First Development.
//
// Reference: specs/seraphis-phase4-continuous-body/spec.md   (SC-005, :1368-1428)
//            specs/seraphis-phase4-continuous-body/plan.md   (S8.3, R-6 at :1816)
//            specs/seraphis-phase4-continuous-body/tasks.md  (T002 registers this
//                                                             TU, T016 fills it)
//
// SCOPE OF THIS TU: the CPU-budget case only, `ContinuousBody_CpuBudget`.
//
// WHY ns/block AND NOT "% of one core":
//   A percent-of-core figure is not reproducible across dev machines or CI
//   runners - identical code passes or fails by hardware. SC-005 therefore pins
//   the measurement basis to NANOSECONDS PER 512-SAMPLE BLOCK (the basis
//   `dsp/tests/unit/systems/harmonic_cloud_perf_test.cpp:8-25` established) and
//   gates against a CHECKED-IN BASELINE as a relative regression bound
//   (fail if > baseline x 1.5). The percent-of-budget figure is REPORTED via
//   WARN, never asserted.
//
// HOW THE ABSOLUTE ROADMAP FIGURE IS STILL BOUND (spec.md:1378-1394):
//   roadmap line 221 makes "<= 1 % of one core per voice" a FUNCTIONAL
//   requirement, and roadmap lines 488-489 make CPU budgets FRs generally, so a
//   purely relative gate would not discharge SC-005. Each checked-in baseline
//   therefore carries BOTH compile-time clauses
//
//       static_assert(baseline * kRegressionFactor <= reference, ...);
//       static_assert(baseline <= reference / kRegressionFactor, ...);
//
//   alongside the run-time REQUIRE(measured <= baseline * kRegressionFactor).
//   The two COMPOSE: a baseline that would let `measured` exceed the reference
//   does not COMPILE, so the run-time REQUIRE transitively binds the absolute
//   figure on every machine and every run. The "[.perf]" tag keeps the TIMING
//   out of CI (.github/workflows/ci.yml excludes perf-tagged cases), but the
//   static_asserts are evaluated by every CI leg regardless of tags - which is
//   exactly why the gate is placed there.
//
// IF A MEASUREMENT IS OVER BUDGET: REDUCE COST, NEVER RAISE THE BASELINE
//   (the rule stated at `harmonic_cloud_perf_test.cpp:82-85`). Levers, in order:
//     1. verify FR-042a's RELATIVE dirty gate is actually firing. A bug that
//        dirties every control step pays `computeModeCoefficients`' sqrt + 2 sin
//        + exp per mode (~128 transcendentals for a 32-mode bank, plan S8.3) on
//        every 64-sample chunk - the single largest lever on the operating point.
//     2. verify RA-4's fast path: `modDepth` must reach EXACTLY 0 through the
//        smoother, or `DiffusionNetwork` evaluates 8 std::sin per sample per
//        instance (~384 k/s at 48 kHz - correction C-7).
//     3. verify FR-053a's cloud bypass engages at `cloudMix = 0` with a settled
//        loop.
//     4. hoist `G_hat` behind the SAME dirty flag as `updateModes` - they share
//        inputs. Never compute `G_hat` unconditionally.
//     5. raise `kNyquistHeadroomOct` above 1.0 to truncate harder. This trades
//        SPECIFIED glide headroom (FR-043) for CPU and is open item OQ-D: flag
//        it and justify it in `continuous_body.h`, never make the trade silently.
//     6. only then escalate.
//   `ContinuousBody::kModeCountCeiling` is fixed at 32 (A-3 / OQ-2) and is NOT a
//   lever - see the static_assert on it below.
//
// This TU does NOT inject non-finite values, so it is deliberately NOT listed in
// the -fno-fast-math -fno-finite-math-only source-property block. It also has no
// std::isnan / std::isinf / numeric_limits infinity anywhere: the macOS leg
// builds with -ffast-math, which folds them. Finiteness is checked on the
// IEEE-754 exponent field instead.
//
// NO ALLOCATION-TRACKING INCLUDES HERE: this TU must not pull in
// <allocation_operator_overrides.h> (duplicate-symbol link error against the
// single owner in this binary), and does not need it - SC-006 is covered in
// continuous_body_test.cpp.
//
// FTZ/DAZ: dsp_test_main.cpp:13 calls enableFTZDAZ() before any case runs, so
// every figure below is measured with denormals flushed BY THE PROCESS - the
// same environment the audio thread runs in. That is also the precondition the
// 30 s tail probe at the end of this file checks has not been undone by the
// cloud's own feedback write (risk R-6, plan.md:1816).
//

// The most expensive material is STRINGS in all four configurations, not Metal
// Plate as plan S8.3 predicted. That prediction was made against a modal bank
// whose per-sample cost scaled with the mode count; it no longer does
// (ModalResonatorBank::kSimdModeGranularity removed the Highway kernel's scalar
// tail, which was costing ~9x the vector body and made 11 modes and 29 modes
// cost the same). With the mode loop vectorised end to end, the 32-mode plate is
// CHEAPER than the single waveguide string, whose loop is a serial chain of a
// fractional-delay read, a DC blocker, four dispersion allpasses and a loss
// filter that no amount of vector width can shorten.
//
// HOW THE FOUR CONSTANTS BELOW ARE SET, and what is true of each:
//
//   baseline = min( round-up(worst of the eight runs), kMaxAdmissible* )
//
// - crossfade  53.9 -> 54,000, and 54,000 <= kMaxAdmissible1PctNs (71,111).
//   PINNED TO THE MEASUREMENT.
// - cloud only 26.4 -> 26,500, and 26,500 <= kMaxAdmissibleHalfPctNs (35,555).
//   PINNED TO THE MEASUREMENT.
// - steady     35.7 -> 35,800, which EXCEEDS kMaxAdmissibleHalfPctNs by 0.7 %,
//   so it is capped at 35,500. The regression bound on this configuration is
//   therefore 53,250 ns rather than the 53,550 a measurement-pinned baseline
//   would give - 0.6 % looser than intended, and still 49 % above the worst
//   figure ever measured.
// - operating  41.1 -> 41,200, which exceeds kMaxAdmissibleHalfPctNs by 15.7 %,
//   so it is capped at 35,500. The regression bound is 53,250 ns against a worst
//   measurement of 41,141, i.e. 29 % of headroom instead of the 50 % a
//   measurement-pinned baseline gives. This is the ONE configuration where the
//   regression bound is materially looser than SC-005 intends, and it is
//   recorded here rather than hidden: the absolute clause is untouched
//   (41,141 ns is 0.386 % of one core, inside both the 0.5 % per-configuration
//   reference and the roadmap's 1 % per-voice ceiling), but a future 25 %
//   regression on the operating point would not be caught by this gate.
//
// WHAT THESE NUMBERS REPLACED. Before the Phase 4 optimisation pass the same
// case measured, worst material per configuration: steady 132-152, operating
// 304, crossfade 200, cloud only (never reached - the case aborted on the first
// REQUIRE). The steady figure alone was 2.5x the 0.5 % reference and 1.4x the
// roadmap's absolute 1 % ceiling. The reduction came from six changes, each
// bit-identical or with its non-identity argued at the site:
//   1. ModalResonatorBank::kSimdModeGranularity - pad the count handed to the
//      Highway kernel to a whole number of vectors, with the padding lanes held
//      at zero coefficients and zero state. Removes the scalar tail. Modal bank,
//      512-sample block: 51,520 -> 5,582 ns at 11 modes.
//   2. DiffusionNetwork static fast path + snapSmoothers(), and ContinuousBody
//      forwarding its OWN smoothed size/width once per control chunk (which is
//      also what FR-009's 50 ms / 20 ms columns actually require).
//      Cascade, 512-sample block: 49,828 -> 15,197 ns.
//   3. TimeVaryingCombBank zero-modulation guard + processBlock() +
//      snapSmoothers(). 6 combs, 512-sample block: 74,580 -> ~23,000 ns.
//   4. FeedbackComb::makeTap()/process(x, tap) and DelayLine::LinearTap /
//      AllpassTap / processFixedTap - the per-sample clamp, floor and float
//      DIVISION of a fractional-delay read, hoisted where the delay is static.
//   5. WaveguideString: memoised loop-loss gain (a std::exp2 and a std::pow per
//      sample for a constant) plus snapSmoothers().
//   6. ContinuousBody: memoised seed detune and amplitude tables, and a G-hat
//      that reads the bank's freshly-computed coefficients instead of
//      re-deriving four transcendentals per mode from the frequency table.
//
// A measurement above the applicable REFERENCE figure is a SPEC FAILURE. Reduce

    // the feedback write - and this is the measurement that says it is working.
