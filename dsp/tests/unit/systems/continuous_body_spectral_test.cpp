// =============================================================================
// SC-015 - the steady-state gain bound is both VALID and TIGHT (FR-032)
// =============================================================================
// FR-032 is the new DSP work of this phase and its central claim - that `G-hat`
// upper-bounds the engine's steady-state gain - is asserted nowhere else.
// SC-007 measures the POST-compensation level, which would also pass if `G-hat`
// were systematically wrong in a way the AGC absorbed. That is why this case is
// written and run BEFORE SC-007 (tasks.md T008).
//
// @par What each clause discriminates
//   - VALIDITY (`measuredGain <= G-hat`) fails if the bound UNDER-estimates,
//     i.e. if the drive law lets an engine exceed its own compensation target.
//     Stated plainly, because it is the WEAKER of the two clauses: with the
//     compensation unclamped, `measuredGain = peak * G-hat`, and the modal
//     engine's own output stage soft-clips at kEngineClipThreshold = 1.0
//     (`modal_resonator_bank.h:816-823`, `dsp_utils.h:105-113`), so `peak < 1`
//     always and the inequality is close to structural. What it still catches is
//     the compensation running into kMinDriveGain/kMaxDriveGain (i.e. a G-hat so
//     far out that the clamp, not the bound, sets the level) and any future
//     change to the engine's output-stage threshold. TIGHTNESS below is the
//     clause that actually discriminates a right bound from a wrong one.
//   - TIGHTNESS (`measuredGain >= 0.1 x G-hat` at mode 1) fails if the bound
//     OVER-estimates. The flat-numerator form an earlier spec draft carried
//     ignores the transfer function's zero at `z = R` and over-estimates by
//     ~35x (31 dB) at 220 Hz / 48 kHz, i.e. `measuredGain / G-hat ~ 0.029`.
//     The correct form predicts a ratio near `g_1 / Sum g_k` times an O(1)
//     factor; computed from the shipped tables at f_body = 220 Hz / 48 kHz that
//     is 0.33 (Glass, 11 modes after FR-043's truncation), 0.16 (Metal Plate,
//     29 modes) and 0.44 (Ice, 10 modes) - all far above 0.1, and all far above
//     the 0.029 the rejected form produces.
//
// @par Why the excitation frequency is getModeFrequencyHz(k), not (k+1) x f_body
// `getModeFrequencyHz` recovers the WARPED frequency the bank actually resonates
// at, from the stored epsilon (`modal_resonator_bank.h:473-482`). Stretch and
// scatter move Ice's mode 0 by +2.16 cents and Metal Plate's by +0.19 cents
// relative to `f_body`, and at these Q values (a 23 s T60 is a 0.048 Hz
// half-power half-width at 220 Hz) two cents is several linewidths - driving at
// `f_body` would measure the probe's tuning error, not the drive law.
//
// @par Cost
// ~2000 s of rendered audio (3 materials x 4 resonances x 8 modes, each render
// self-sized to max(5 s, 3 x T60)). It is far faster than real time, but this is
// the heaviest case in the TU and the render length is fixed by the criterion's
// own steady-state definition, not by a tunable.

//   one 8192-point Hann FFT -> discard DC -> the remaining 4096 bins -> dB
//   relative to that render's OWN peak bin -> clamp at a -80 dB floor -> map to
//   [0,1] as (dB + 80)/80.
//   Distance = MEAN ABSOLUTE DIFFERENCE PER BIN (0.0125 = 1 dB average per-bin
//   difference).
//   (a2) and (d) analyse the driven last-1.0 s window, exactly as specified.
//   (a1) analyses the seed-AVERAGED FREE RING - see `averagedRingProfile` for
//   the measurement that forces it, and the (a1) block below for the noise
//   reference. Neither threshold moves.
//
// @par Why (a1) is the clause with teeth
// (a2)'s absolute floor of 0.02 says only that two spectra differ by 1.6 dB per
// bin on average. It cannot tell a material difference from MEASUREMENT NOISE.
// (a1) puts the two on the same scale: every one of the 10 cross-material

// @par If the matrix misses
// The instruction is explicit and is repeated here so it is not lost: CHANGE THE
// FR-011a PROFILES UNTIL THE MATERIALS REALLY ARE DISTINCT - never lower a
// threshold. It was followed, not sidestepped: Ice's `amplitudeExponent` and
// `scatter` were both re-valued against measurement in this pass (see the
// profile table in continuous_body.h). What could NOT be fixed that way is
// documented at `averagedRingProfile`: the driven single-periodogram floor is
// larger than any cross-material distance among the three modal materials, so
// no profile set can clear it.

// loop traversals, right on FR-052's own ">= 4x loopSeconds" boundary. The

// default requires, and every point reports its measured value through WARN so
// the decision is made against real numbers rather than the simulation's.
