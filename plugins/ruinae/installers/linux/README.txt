                       RUINAE VST3 SYNTHESIZER PLUGIN
                           Installation Guide
================================================================================

Thank you for downloading Ruinae, a chaos/spectral hybrid synthesizer plugin
by Krate Audio.


INSTALLATION
------------

User Installation (Recommended):
   Copy the plugin to your personal VST3 folder:

   cp -r Ruinae.vst3 ~/.vst3/

   This makes the plugin available only to your user account.


System-Wide Installation:
   For all users on the system, copy to the system VST3 folder:

   sudo cp -r Ruinae.vst3 /usr/lib/vst3/

   This requires administrator (root) privileges.


FACTORY PRESETS
---------------

Factory presets are included in the presets/ folder within this archive.

User Installation (Recommended):
   Copy presets to your personal presets folder:

   mkdir -p ~/Documents/Krate\ Audio/Ruinae
   cp -r presets/* ~/Documents/Krate\ Audio/Ruinae/

System-Wide Installation:
   For all users on the system:

   sudo mkdir -p /usr/share/krate-audio/ruinae
   sudo cp -r presets/* /usr/share/krate-audio/ruinae/


VERIFICATION
------------

After installation, verify the plugin is recognized:

1. Open your DAW (Digital Audio Workstation)
2. Rescan VST3 plugins (if your DAW doesn't auto-detect)
3. Look for "Ruinae" in your plugin list under Instruments > Synth


SUPPORTED DAWs
--------------

Ruinae has been tested with the following Linux DAWs:

- Bitwig Studio
- Ardour
- REAPER (with VST3 support enabled)
- Renoise
- Qtractor
- Carla (VST host)

Any DAW that supports VST3 instruments should work.


TROUBLESHOOTING
---------------

Plugin not appearing in DAW:
- Ensure the .vst3 folder was copied completely (including all subfolders)
- Check that your DAW is configured to scan ~/.vst3/ or /usr/lib/vst3/
- Try rescanning plugins manually in your DAW's settings

Permission errors:
- For user installation: ensure ~/.vst3/ exists (mkdir -p ~/.vst3/)
- For system installation: use sudo as shown above
