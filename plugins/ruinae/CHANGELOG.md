# Changelog

All notable changes to Ruinae will be documented in this file.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/),
and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## [0.10.0] - 2026-03-20

### Added

- **MPE (MIDI Polyphonic Expression) support** — Per-note expression routing via VST3 NoteExpression events. Each voice tracks its own noteId, enabling independent per-note tuning (±120 semitones), volume (0–4x gain), and brightness (±48 semitone filter cutoff offset). The shared MIDI dispatcher's C++20 concept detection automatically routes MPE events when the noteId-aware callbacks are present
- **Per-note pitch via NoteExpression tuning** — Expression tuning offsets applied multiplicatively to oscillator frequencies, stacking with per-oscillator tuning and modulation
- **Per-note volume via NoteExpression volume** — Expression volume multiplied into the VCA stage alongside the amplitude envelope
- **Per-note brightness via NoteExpression brightness** — Expression brightness mapped to ±48 semitone filter cutoff offset, adding spectral control per voice
- **Global pitch bend callback** — `onPitchBend` routes through the existing NoteProcessor for global pitch bend, combinable with per-note expression tuning
- **noteId-aware voice allocation** — Engine stamps noteId on allocated voices and uses noteId-first lookup for note-off, ensuring accurate MPE voice targeting

### Fixed

- **Arpeggiator note value dropdown count mismatch** — Tests hardcoded 21 entries (stepCount=20) but the DSP layer's `kNoteValueDropdownCount` was updated to 30. Fixed tests and added missing note value labels (2/1, 3/1, 4/1 variants) to `formatArpParam`

## [0.9.13] - 2026-03-17

### Fixed

- **Envelope timing completely wrong** — Amp and mod envelope decay/attack/release times were drastically shorter than specified (e.g., 10s decayed in ~1s). Root cause: curve amounts were never applied to amp and mod envelopes, leaving them on the one-pole exponential path instead of the phase-based table path. Added float curve setter overloads in engine and wired them in the processor
- **Bezier curves ignored by envelopes** — Bezier control points were stored in parameters but never forwarded to the DSP engine. Added Bezier curve setters for all three envelopes (amp, filter, mod) and conditional application in the processor when Bezier mode is enabled
- **ADSR playback dot doesn't follow curve** — The playback indicator dot moved in a straight line instead of tracing the drawn curve path. Added inverse curve table lookup to compute the correct phase from the output level, so the dot now follows Bezier and power curves accurately

### Changed

- **ADSR mode toggle labels** — In the expanded overlay (>500px width), the Bezier/Simple toggle button now shows full "Bezier"/"Simple" labels instead of abbreviated "B"/"S"

## [0.9.12] - 2026-03-13

### Added

- **Mod source visualisers** — UI-thread visualisers for Rungler (XY Lissajous plot, CV staircase, shift register bits), Sample & Hold (scrolling time-series with trigger markers and slew smoothing), and Random (scrolling output with smoothness morphing) mod sources. Also added shared LFO waveform and Chaos mod display components
- **Sidechain input bus** — Auxiliary stereo sidechain input for audio-dependent mod sources (EnvFollower, PitchFollower, Transient). Falls back to analyzing the synth's own output when no sidechain is connected
- **Sidechain status indicators** — CTextLabel indicators on EnvFollower, PitchFollower, and Transient mod source views showing connection state (green "SIDECHAIN ACTIVE" / amber "NO SIDECHAIN — analyzing synth output")
- **ADSR expanded overlay** — New overlay component for expanded ADSR envelope editing

## [0.9.11] - 2026-03-12

### Added

- **Chorus effect** — New stereo chorus DSP processor (Layer 2) with LFO-modulated delay lines, configurable depth and rate, and true dry/wet crossfade. Parameters: Rate (0.1–5 Hz), Depth, Mix, Voices (1–4), Stereo Spread
- **Chorus UI controls** — New CHORUS fieldset on the FX tab with enable toggle, knobs, and voice selector
- **Chorus preset support** — Chorus parameters included in state save/load with backward-compatible defaults for older presets

### Fixed

- **Harmonizer + reverb clipping artifacts** — Combined signal from harmonizer voices exceeded ±1.0, causing hard compression through the output limiter. Fixed with three changes: harmonizer wet bus now scales by 1/√N (N = active voices), new threshold-based soft limiter (`softLimit`) preserves signals below 0.85 and only saturates peaks, and inter-stage soft limiting between harmonizer and reverb prevents overdriving the reverb feedback network. Click count reduced ~60%, max sample step reduced ~25%

## [0.9.10] - 2026-03-12

### Added

- **Flanger effect** — New stereo flanger DSP processor (Layer 2) with modulated short delay line, LFO-driven comb-filter sweep, and tanh-clipped feedback for resonance control. Parameters: Rate (0.05–5 Hz), Depth, Feedback (±1.0), Mix (true dry/wet crossfade), Stereo Spread (0–360°), Waveform (Sine/Triangle), Tempo Sync with note value selection
- **Modulation type selector** — The phaser enable toggle is replaced by a three-way selector (None / Phaser / Flanger) in the modulation slot. Switching between effects uses a 30ms linear-ramp crossfade for click-free transitions. Only one modulation effect is active at a time
- **Flanger UI controls** — Modulation fieldset shows context-appropriate controls: flanger knobs and dropdowns when Flanger is selected, phaser controls when Phaser is selected, or a "No modulation" label when None is selected
- **Backward-compatible preset migration** — Old presets with `phaserEnabled` are automatically migrated: enabled → Phaser, disabled → None. All flanger parameters default gracefully when absent from older state streams

### Changed

- **Modulation fieldset renamed** — "PHASER" fieldset is now "MODULATION" to reflect the expanded modulation slot

## [0.9.9] - 2026-03-11

### Fixed

- **Dattorro plate reverb bandwidth filter** — Filter coefficient derivation was inverted, producing a 3.8 Hz lowpass instead of the near-transparent filter specified in the Dattorro paper. The reverb now has proper frequency response and much richer sound
- **Plate reverb decay range** — Recalibrated roomSize-to-decay mapping from [0.75, 0.9995] to [0.50, 0.90] to give musically useful RT60 range (~2-12 seconds) with the corrected bandwidth filter. Previously roomSize=100% produced a 42-minute tail
- **Plate reverb output gain** — Reduced from 3.0 to 0.6 to compensate for correct bandwidth filter energy levels
- **Tank modulation interpolation** — Upgraded DD1 modulated allpass reads from linear to cubic Hermite interpolation, reducing HF loss in the recirculating tank
- **LFO amplitude drift on rate changes** — Gordon-Smith phasor now renormalized to the unit circle when modulation rate changes, preventing amplitude drift
- **Input diffusion stale buffers** — Diffusion allpasses are now always processed (even at diffusion=0) to prevent stale audio bursts when re-enabling diffusion
- **DD2 integer delay read** — Fixed unnecessary linear interpolation on integer-length delays
- **Output tap bounds checking** — Tap positions are now clamped against section lengths in prepare() to prevent buffer overruns at unusual sample rates
- **Per-sample damping overhead** — Damping filter coefficient now cached to avoid redundant exp() calls when cutoff hasn't changed

## [0.9.8] - 2026-03-08

### Added

- **Arpeggiator Chord Lane** — New per-step chord type lane (None/Dyad/Triad/7th/9th) that generates chords by stacking diatonic scale degrees using the arp's scale harmonizer. Transforms the arpeggiator from a single-note sequencer into a harmonic sequencer
- **Arpeggiator Inversion Lane** — Per-step chord inversion control (Root/1st/2nd/3rd) for voice-leading variety across the pattern
- **Global Voicing Mode** — Close, Drop-2, Spread, and Random voicing options that control how chord notes are distributed across registers
- **5 new "Arp Chords" factory presets** — Diatonic Triads, Minor 7th Pulse, Chord Cascade, Spread Ninths, Stab Machine

### Fixed

- **Condition lane popup menu positioning** — COptionMenu popups on condition, chord, and inversion lanes now appear at the clicked step instead of at an incorrect offset

## [0.9.7] - 2026-03-08

### Added

- **Arpeggiator Pitch as global modulation source** — Arp pitch (last played arp note) is now available as a modulation source in the global mod matrix, enabling pitch-following effects like filter tracking or delay time modulation

### Changed

- **Enriched factory presets** — Deeper modulation routing across factory presets for more expressive out-of-the-box sound design

### Fixed

- **Voice mod routes disappearing on click** — Clicking any control in a voice modulation row caused all voice routes to vanish. Root cause: VST3's synchronous `sendMessage→notify` chain caused re-entrant `VoiceModRouteState` responses to overwrite the grid during callback execution
- **Voice mod route delete button not working** — The remove button appeared to do nothing because the processor's synchronous response overwrote the grid mid-loop, undoing the shift-up operation
- **Voice route interactions corrupting global mod parameters** — Voice route detail controls (curve, smooth, scale, bypass, amount) were incorrectly calling `beginEdit`/`performEdit`/`endEdit` on global mod matrix parameter IDs. Voice routes now communicate exclusively via IMessage

## [0.9.6] - 2026-03-07

### Fixed

- **ADSR envelope edits not persisting when switching tabs** — Dragging envelope control points only called `performEdit` (sending values to the host/processor) but did not call `setParamNormalized` to update the controller's internal parameter state. Switching between envelope tabs and back would show stale pre-edit values. Now both calls are made, matching the pattern used by all other custom editors.

## [0.9.5] - 2026-03-05

### Added

- **In-plugin update checker** — Automatically checks for new versions on editor open (24h cooldown) and shows a non-intrusive banner with download link when an update is available
- **"Check for Updates" button** — Manual version check in the settings panel
- **Version label** — Dynamic version display in the top bar
- Version dismiss functionality for update notifications
- **Category dropdown in quick-save preset dialog** — Preset save dialog now includes a category selector

### Changed

- **Removed dynamic voice-count gain compensation** — Eliminated phantom volume boost caused by gain scaling adjusting mid-note when voices overlapped

### Fixed

- **Harmonizer silent after preset load** — Use-after-free crash on preset switch fixed by nulling dangling view pointers
- **Global LFO retrigger not firing on note-on** — LFO phase was not resetting when retrigger was enabled
- **Near-silent chaos presets** — Chaos oscillator presets producing barely audible output due to incorrect gain staging
- **VSTGUI crash during rapid preset switching** — Multiple use-after-free and null-pointer issues in view lifecycle during bulk parameter loads
- **Preset loading race conditions** — RTTransferT lock-free transfer prevents data races on voice routes during preset switches
- **Spectral distortion drive scaling and output buffer clobbering** — Drive parameter had incorrect range mapping; output buffer was being overwritten
- **Inactive spectral distortion controls not dimmed** — Curve dropdown and bits controls now gray out based on spectral mode selection
- **Bass presets missing from preset browser** — Category filtering excluded bass subcategory
- **Euclidean Bells preset** — Opened filter and initialized all partials to full amplitude

## [0.9.4] - 2026-03-02

### Added

- **ARP Save Preset button** — "Save" button on the arpeggiator tab opens the ARP preset browser with the save dialog shown, defaulting to "Arp Classic" subcategory

- **Distinct FX tab section colors** — Each effect section (Phaser, Delay, Harmonizer, Reverb) now has its own accent color
- **MOD tab layout** — Redistributed controls and fixed mod source dropdown display
- **Preset browser filtering** — ARP presets hidden from synth preset browser via tab label filtering

### Fixed

- **CI AUv3 verify step** — No longer fails when only a subset of plugins changed

## [0.9.3] - 2026-03-02

### Added

- **30 new synth presets** across 6 categories: Basses (5), Leads (5), Pads (5), Rhythmic (5), Textures (5), Experimental (5)
- **Crash-proof preset loading** — RTTransferT lock-free triple-buffer safely transfers preset state to the audio thread, preventing data races on voiceRoutes during preset switches

### Fixed

- **Chaos oscillator producing inaudible DC output** — Lorenz, Rossler, and Chua attractors were evolving at sub-audio rates (0.3-10 Hz instead of 440 Hz) due to incorrect baseDt calibration. Recalibrated all three attractors and adjusted gain compensation. The Chaos Wind preset and all chaos-type oscillator presets now produce proper audible audio.

## [0.9.2] - 2026-03-01

### Added

- **Ring Modulator distortion type** — New per-voice distortion with internal sine oscillator, waveform selection (Sine, Triangle, Square, Saw), fixed/ratio frequency modes, depth control, and stereo spread
- **Ring Modulator DSP processor** (KrateDSP Layer 2) with DC offset removal

### Changed

- **UI layout: taller Row 1 and Row 2** — Added 25px height to each of the first two rows on the Sound tab for better visual spacing
- **Knob label positioning** — Labels beneath ArcKnobs in oscillator, filter, and distortion sub-panels now render below the knob rather than overlapping it
- **Sub-panel heights increased** — Oscillator type-specific panels (32→48px), filter/distortion sub-panels (88→113px) to use the added room

## [0.9.1] - 2026-02-28

### Added

  - 16 scale types: Chromatic, Major, Natural Minor, Harmonic Minor, Melodic Minor, Dorian, Phrygian, Lydian, Mixolydian, Locrian, Major Pentatonic, Minor Pentatonic, Blues, Whole Tone, Diminished (W-H), Diminished (H-W)
  - 12 root notes (C through B)
  - Pitch lane interprets step values as scale degree offsets when a non-Chromatic scale is active (e.g., +2 in C Major = E, not D)
  - Correct octave wrapping for all scale sizes (5-12 notes)
  - Scale Quantize Input toggle: snaps incoming MIDI notes to the nearest scale note before entering the arp pool
  - Root Note and Scale Quantize Input controls dim when Chromatic is selected
  - Pitch lane popup suffix changes from "st" to "deg" in scale mode
  - Chromatic mode (default) is identical to pre-feature behavior

- **Harmonizer scale extension** — Harmonizer dropdown now exposes all 16 scale types (was 9)

  - Arp Polymetric: 3x5x7_Evolving, 4x5_Shifting

### Fixed

- **Stuck notes with arp slide modifier**: Poly-legato glide changed voice pitch without updating the voice allocator's note tracking, so the subsequent noteOff for the new pitch couldn't find the voice. The allocator note is now updated after glide.
