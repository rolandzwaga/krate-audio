//
// CRITERIA OWNED BY THIS TU (plan sec. 7.0's test-file map):
//   SC-008  the parameter-push CPU budget, at the threshold plan sec. 7.8 pins from
//           measurement (ceil(worst x 1.05))
//   SC-009  the full-polyphony budget driven from plan sec. 7.9's exhaustively
//           enumerated non-default parameter table (91 rows in Phase 9)
//
// PHASE 10 (specs/seraphis-phase10-effects/{spec,plan,tasks}.md, task T025):
//   SC-014  Phase 9's SC-009 arm RE-RUN with the effects section active - the
//           same subject, the same UNRELAXED gate (kFullPolyCeilingNs = 25 % and
//           kBaselineFullPolyNs x kRegressionFactor; neither is a lever, and
//           kBaselineFullPolyNs is already the maximum both static_asserts admit)
//           with kNonDefaultTable grown 91 -> 107 rows, the sixteen effects rows
//           at their MEASURED most-expensive end (FR-038a clauses 3-4). The
//           measurement lives in "Seraphis_EffectsTable_IsTheWorstCase" at the
//           bottom of this file; its rationale is the PHASE 10 BASELINE
//           PROVENANCE banner beside the table.
//
// EVERY CASE HERE IS TAGGED "[.perf]" - hidden by default, run explicitly with
//   seraphis_tests.exe "[.perf]"
//
// COMPILE FLAGS: this TU MUST NOT be listed under "-fno-fast-math
//   -fno-finite-math-only" in plugins/seraphis/tests/CMakeLists.txt - those
//   flags move the figures its baselines are pinned to. Same rule as
//   dsp/tests/CMakeLists.txt:735-740. It therefore injects NO non-finite value
//   and names no std::isnan / std::isinf / std::numeric_limits infinity: the
//   macOS leg builds with -ffast-math, which folds them. Finiteness is checked
//   on the IEEE-754 exponent field instead (isFiniteValue below).

// BASELINE STATUS (2026-08-02) - ALL FIVE BASELINES PINNED AND GATING
// ==============================================================================
//   T027 wrote the STRUCTURE: the three SC-008 arms, the SC-009 subject, the
//   91-row table, the optimization barriers and the non-zero-elapsed clauses.
//   T028 ran them and checked in four of the five measured numbers. The fifth,
//   SC-009's, was ESCALATED (it could not be pinned at ceil(worst x 1.05) on a
//   machine that was not cold) and was closed on 2026-08-02 by the seven-run
//   COLD-MACHINE dataset below. Outcome:
//
//     SC-008 arms 1-3  PINNED (T028) from the six-run dataset in BASELINE
//                      PROVENANCE below, as ceil(worst x kBaselineHeadroom).
//                      The 2026-08-02 cold dataset re-verifies every one of
//                      them UNDER its pin, so no SC-008 pin moved.
//     SC-009           PINNED (2026-08-02), CEILING-DERIVED. The cold dataset's
//                      worst is 2 230 830 ns (20.9141 %), but ceil(worst x 1.05)
//                      = 2 342 372 collides with the 25 % ceiling through
//                      kRegressionFactor, so the baseline is the largest value
//                      the static_asserts admit - floor(25 % / 1.15) = 2 318 840
//                      - per the FR-057 amendment of 2026-08-02. See
//                      "SC-009: HOW ITS BASELINE WAS PINNED" below.
//
//   The two flags stay separate because they were pinned from different datasets
//   on different dates, and the provenance of a gate is part of the gate. The
//   invariant that forced the split is unchanged and is now satisfied by both:
//   a placeholder must not be able to pass or fail anything, and evidence must.
//   Nothing here is relaxed: the 25 % ceiling, kRegressionFactor and
//   kBaselineHeadroom are all exactly what T028 left them.
//
//   What gates on every run, pinned or not:
//     - FR-057's ABSOLUTE ceilings (0.05 % / 0.50 % of the block budget) and
//       SC-009's 25 %-of-one-core ceiling. These are SPEC constants, not
//       measurements, so they bind from the first run.
//     - the strictly-non-zero elapsed time of every arm (a 0 ns arm FAILS).
//     - every static_assert tying a baseline to its reference.
//   NO ARM IS COMPILED OUT (plan sec. 7.8's closing sentence): all four measurements
//   run in every configuration; only the SC-009 baseline COMPARISON is deferred.

//   Run 6 is the verification run taken AFTER the first five were pinned; it is

//   arm 3's subdivided/undivided ratio per run: 1.038, 1.059, 1.067, 1.003,

//   whole-block wall time, so plan sec. 3.5.4's "coarsen the grid to 128 samples"
//   remedy is NOT needed and sec. 7.6's positive control keeps the grid it was
//   constructed on. (The ratio is noisy because BOTH figures are whole-block
//   renders of a ~13 % -of-core chain; it is reported, never gated.)
//
//   SC-008 arm 2 DOES NOT BREACH FR-057's 0.50 %: the worst push is

// ==============================================================================
// SC-009: WHY ITS BASELINE COULD NOT BE PINNED IN T028 (kept - it is the reason
// the cold dataset below exists, and it is what the pin is measured against)
// ==============================================================================
//   The RAW CRITERION PASSED on all six T028 runs: 2582570 ns worst <=
//   2666666.7 ns, i.e. 24.21 % of one core against the 25 % ceiling - but with
//   only 3.2 % margin. The baseline discipline is what it failed:
//
//     kMaxAdmissibleFullPolyNs = 25 % / 1.15            = 2318840.6 ns (21.74 %)
//     a baseline is admissible only if ceil(measured x 1.05) <= that,
//     i.e. only if measured <= 2208419.6 ns                            (20.70 %)
//     WORST measured of six                            = 2582570   ns (24.21 %)
//     ceil(worst x 1.05) - THE SHIPPABLE BASELINE      = 2711699   ns (25.42 %) X
//     best  measured of six                            = 2204830   ns (20.67 %)
//     ceil(best  x 1.05)                               = 2315072   ns (21.70 %) ok
//
//   The discipline pins ceil(WORST x 1.05), and that value failed BOTH SC-009
//   static_asserts below, which is why T028 escalated rather than patched. The
//   shape of the finding was "on the boundary", not "wildly over": exactly ONE
//   of the six runs landed under the admissibility threshold, and the
//   run-to-run spread (20.67 %-24.21 %) was itself larger than the margin the
//   discipline needs.
//
//   THE MECHANISM IS THE ONE THIS FILE ALREADY NAMES. The 91-row table drives
//   Atmosphere Freeze Mix (row 1007) to 1.0 with the atmosphere frozen, so
//   renderFreezeLayer's `settledDry` bypass cannot engage - the note at the
//   freeze precondition below prices that at 1.048 % -> 1.440 % per voice, i.e.
//   +3.1 points at 8 voices. Phase 7's ~19 % + 3.1 = ~22.1 %. Phase 9 adds no
//   DSP to the chain; it drives the surface that was already there to its
//   non-default values, which is what SC-009 asks for.

// SC-009: HOW ITS BASELINE WAS PINNED (COLD-MACHINE DATASET, 2026-08-02)
// ==============================================================================
//   T028's escalation named three admissible remedies - the shipped voice
//   count, Phase 9's own push cost, or a phase-owner ruling recorded as a spec
//   amendment. The third was taken, and it was taken only after the measurement
//   precondition SC-008's own discipline states ("best-of-16 per subject, >= 8
//   trials, IDLE MACHINE", spec.md:2154-2157) was actually met for the first
//   time.

//   20.9141, 19.9069, 20.5228 - median 20.5228 %, worst 20.9141 %, a 1.01-point
//   band. The 16-voice non-gating figure is 39.01-39.41 %, i.e. ~1.9x the
//   8-voice cost and 1.57x the ceiling, which is the number FR-058 clause 1
//   writes into the roadmap amendment and the reason the gate is 8.
//
//   THE MACHINE STATE WAS VALIDATED, NOT ASSUMED. Phase 7's own SC-001 case
//   (dsp_systems_tests.exe "SeraphisEngine_FullPolyCpuBudget"), which contains
//   NO Phase 9 code, was run three times in the same cold session: 20.0104 %,
//   19.5613 %, 17.6045 %, all three PASSING their own Phase 7 gate and all
//   inside/below the 18.34 %-20.07 % band Phase 7 recorded. That is the control
//   the earlier failing pass lacked: on a HOT machine the same control read
//   23.623/24.784/24.4679 % (a +27 to +32 % whole-machine slowdown) while
//   SC-009 read a 28.30 % median - which is how the hot breaches were
//   established as thermal/power degradation rather than a Phase 9 cost.
//
//   THE ARITHMETIC OF THE PIN, and why it is CEILING-DERIVED:
//     WORST measured of seven                          = 2230830   ns (20.9141 %)
//     ceil(worst x 1.05) - the discipline's first pick = 2342372   ns (21.9598 %)
//       vs kMaxAdmissibleFullPolyNs = 25 % / 1.15      = 2318840.6 ns (21.7391 %) X
//       and 2342372 x 1.15 = 2693728 ns vs the 25 % ceiling 2666666.7 ns       X
//     floor(25 % / 1.15) - THE PINNED BASELINE         = 2318840   ns (21.7391 %) ok
//       and 2318840 x 1.15 = 2666666 ns <= 2666666.7 ns                        ok
//
//   So ceil(worst x 1.05) STILL collides with the ceiling, by 1.0 % - far
//   closer than T028's 16.9 %, but a collision. Per FR-057's amendment of
//   2026-08-02 (spec.md), the ceiling is the binding constraint, and the
//   baseline is pinned at the largest value the static_asserts admit. THIS IS A
//   GENUINE BOUND, NOT A FICTION: the cold worst (2230830) is 3.8 % UNDER the
//   pinned baseline and 16.3 % under the gate it produces, so a regression has
//   to eat the whole cold margin before the gate fires - the gate is weaker than
//   ceil(worst x 1.05) would have been, and that weakness is disclosed here
//   rather than hidden by rounding.
//
//   WHAT WAS NOT DONE, and is still not available: raising the 25 % ceiling,
//   raising kRegressionFactor or kBaselineHeadroom, weakening either
//   static_assert, dropping the voice count below 8, or pinning from a
//   best-of-N rather than the worst.
//
// ==============================================================================
// T029 VERIFICATION DATASET (2026-08-01) - four MORE consecutive runs
// ==============================================================================
//   Taken because a compliance pass reported BOTH SC-008 arm 1 and SC-009 as
//   FAILING, twice, with figures far outside everything above: arm 1 at 127.2
//   and 138.25 / 147.75 ns against a 111.55 ns gate, and SC-009 at 3 076 718 /
//   3 280 679 / 3 704 324 ns (28.84 %, 30.76 %, 34.73 %) against the 25 %
//   ceiling. Those SC-009 figures are 19 %-43 % above the WORST of the six T028
//   runs, so either the phase regressed between T028 and that pass, or that pass
//   was not measured on an idle machine. Four fresh consecutive runs decide it:

//   ("best-of-16 per subject, >= 8 trials, IDLE MACHINE", spec.md:2154-2157)

//
//   THE ESCALATION WAS NOT CLOSED BY THIS DATASET EITHER.

//   unpinned and reported-not-gating after T029. What this dataset settled is only

//   itself holds. It does, on 10 of 10 recorded runs - and on 17 of 17 once the
//   2026-08-02 cold dataset above is counted, which is the dataset that DID close

//     - Processor::process() returns at `data.numSamples <= 0`
//       (processor.cpp:652-654) BEFORE the pre-slice push block, so a zero-sample
//       call cannot isolate it either;
//     - pushVoiceParams / pushMacroSurfaces / pushAetherParamsIfDirty /
//       pushSpectralStatesIfPending / updateSyncedTravelRate / pushGlobalParams
//       are all PRIVATE (processor.h:248-285) and this TU adds no friend seam -
//       the one declared friend (detail::SeraphisParamSmootherBypassProbe,
//       processor.h:122-136) is DEFINED by the SC-005 TU, so defining it here
//       would be an ODR violation inside one binary.
//
//   ARMS 1 AND 2 ARE THEREFORE A TRANSCRIPTION of the pre-slice push block,
//   assembled from the SAME public components the processor uses - the real
//   parameter packs (std::atomic storage), the real Krate::DSP::OnePoleSmoother
//   class-(b) smoothers, the real SeraphisMacroMatrix, the real
//   SeraphisEngine::applyVoiceParams / applySpectralStates and the real
//   Seraphis::applyAetherParams. Only the ~40 tracker scalars and the control
//   flow around them are re-typed here. THAT IS A FIDELITY OBLIGATION, NOT A
//   FREE HAND: every function below cites the processor.cpp lines it mirrors,
//   and any edit to the pre-slice block must be mirrored here or this criterion
//   silently measures a different subject.
//
//   ARM 3 (the class-(b) settling arm) is the exception and needs no
//   transcription: it measures WHOLE-BLOCK wall time, which is exactly what
//   ProcessorFixture::processBlock() already exercises through the real
//   process().
//
// ==============================================================================
// WHY SC-009's SUBJECT IS A HAND-BUILT PAIR AND NOT Processor (plan sec. 7.9)
// ==============================================================================
//   RA-1 row (c) needs numChannels = 16 and diffusionFftSize = 4096.
//   makeSeraphisReverbConfig fixes numChannels = 8 (seraphis_engine_config.h:71)
//   and diffusionFftSize = 1024 with the comment "MUST stay 1024 -> 1024-sample
//   latency" (:82), and that latency constancy is load-bearing for Phase 8
//   (processor.h:329-339). No Phase 9 parameter can change either field, so
//   Processor STRUCTURALLY cannot produce the scenario. The case lives in the
//   PLUGIN perf TU rather than dsp_systems_tests because it needs both the
//   hand-built pair AND Seraphis::applyAetherParams, which is plugin-side
//   (FR-049). Phase 7's precedent for a hand-built pair is
//   dsp/tests/unit/systems/seraphis_perf_test.cpp:1184.
//
// STACK RULE: sizeof(SeraphisEngine) is ~772 KB against MSVC's 1 MiB default
//   main-thread stack (seraphis_engine.h:264-287), so EVERY SeraphisEngine,
//   EVERY AetherReverb and EVERY ContinuousBody here is std::make_unique'd.

// =============================================================================
// Checked in VERBATIM, one plain value per ID, all 107 rows. It is a SPEC
// ARTEFACT, not an implementer's choice. Rule: each row takes the MOST EXPENSIVE
// end of its range, except the three declared exception classes below.
//
// Phase 10 (spec seraphis-phase10-effects, FR-038a clauses 3-4, SC-014) appended
// the sixteen Effects rows (1400-1443) under the SAME rule, which is what turns
// this criterion's scenario into the roadmap's "8 voices, EVERYTHING ON" (roadmap
// lines 313-314) now that the effects section ships. The gate did NOT move:
// kFullPolyCeilingNs (25 %) and kBaselineFullPolyNs x kRegressionFactor are
// exactly what Phase 9 left them, and neither is a lever - see the PHASE 10
// banner below.
//
// THE THREE DECLARED EXCEPTION CLASSES (plan sec. 7.9):
//   class 1 - NOT APPLICABLE, PROCESSOR-LOCAL (8 rows): 0, 100-104, 405, 406.
//             No DSP route. The five macros ARE set here, on the matrix
//             directly, at the FR-060 neutral, so the base overrides reach the
//             voices unmodified - the deep surface is this criterion's subject.
//   class 2 - PINNED BY THE SCENARIO (5 rows): 1 = 8; 1008 = on; 812 = off
//             (bypassing the resonators would remove the body engines from the
//             very chain this criterion budgets); 1201 = 1.0 and 1202 = 1.0,
//             which are RA-1 row (c)'s setSize(1) / setDensity(1).
//   class 3 - THE MOST-EXPENSIVE END COINCIDES WITH THE REGISTERED DEFAULT
//             (12 rows): 2, 208, 700, 803, 805, 808, 810, 811, 1204, 1217, and
//             Phase 10's two MEASURED coincidences 1418 and 1430. Each
//             is defensible under this table's own rule - 208's shortest attack
//             is the busiest envelope, 2's `on` keeps the saturator live, 1204's
//             `off` keeps the shimmer and bloom returns live, 811's `on` keeps
//             the AGC estimator running, and the five unity rows keep their
//             signal paths at full contribution - but each IS the C-6 default,
//             so none of them is a non-default row and the class must be
//             declared. It costs the criterion nothing: SC-009 measures CPU, and
//             a row at the default is still at its most expensive end.
//
// Three row choices carry a note rather than being self-evident:
//   800 = Metal Plate as the modal material with the largest mode set. The case
//         RECORDS getActiveModeCount() for all five materials and takes the
//         maximum; if another material wins, this row changes and the
//         measurement is redone. That is a REQUIRE below, not a comment.
//   1204 = off, not on: freeze makes the shimmer and bloom returns inert, i.e.
//         CHEAPER. The criterion wants the worst case.
//   1206 = 0.0 and 809 = 0.0: minimum damping is the longest ring, i.e. the most
//         sustained work.
//
// Enum-valued rows carry the ENUM INDEX, converted through the same
// dropdown_mappings.h helpers the processor uses (toBodyMaterial etc.), never a
// hand-written cast:
//   403 Spline = 1 (SpectralMorphEngine::TravelMode)
//   409-412 Bell/Choir/Glass/Breath = 1/2/3/4 (SpectralStateId)
//   700 Standard = 0 (SeraphisVoice::EnvelopeMode)
//   800 Metal Plate = 2 (ContinuousBody::BodyMaterial)
//   1016 Blackman = 3 (GrainEnvelopeType)
//   3 = seed INDEX 3 into C-10's curated kSeedValues table, never a constant.
//   408 carries the state COUNT (4) itself, not the dropdown index.
//   1413 CenterOut = 2 (Krate::DSP::SpreadDirection, spectral_delay.h:53-57),
//        converted through Seraphis::toSpreadDirection (dropdown_mappings.h:344).
//   1419 carries the DROPDOWN INDEX into kFxDelaySyncNoteLabels (:267-269), not
//        a note period; index 9 = "1/8T", the longest period the component's own
//        0-9 clamp can reach (spectral_delay.h:532-534, plan D-1).
//
// =============================================================================
// PHASE 10 BASELINE PROVENANCE - the MOST-EXPENSIVE-END dataset for 1400-1443
// =============================================================================
// FR-038a clause 4 / SC-014 make "most expensive end" an OPERATIONAL definition,
// not an argued one: the candidate that maximises measured block wall time. Nine
// of the sixteen rows have a self-evident gradient and are transcribed straight
// from their registered maximum:
//
//   1400 = 1.0     full saturation into TapeSaturator (seraphis_engine.h:672)
//   1410 = 1.0     the send is fully summed; 0.0 is FR-007's total bypass, i.e.
//                  the CHEAPEST possible value and the shipped default
//   1414 = 0.95    kFxDelayFeedbackMax (effects_params.h:71) - the loop sustains
//   1416 = 1.0     diffusion > 0.001 runs applyDiffusion twice per frame plus
//                  two numBins write-backs (spectral_delay.h:881-890)
//   1417 = 1.0     stereoWidth > 0.001 takes the per-bin decorrelation branch
//                  (spectral_delay.h:864-870)
//   1440 = 200.0   MidSideProcessor::kMaxWidth; also the value that ENGAGES the
//                  wander stage, whose FR-010 skip predicate holds at the
//                  100 % / depth-0 default
//   1441 = 1.0     wander depth at maximum - the drift multiply is live
//   1442 = 1.0     wander rate at maximum
//   1443 = 1.0     azimuth depth at maximum - the pan pair is live
//
// The remaining SEVEN have no self-evident gradient, and a structurally-argued
// pick is explicitly NOT sufficient for them (spec Q6): the four discrete rows
// 1413, 1418, 1419, 1430 and the three flat continuous rows 1411, 1412, 1415.
//
// THE DATASET IS NOT A TRANSCRIBED COMMENT - IT RUNS. Phase 9 already refused an
// asserted row once, and the device it used is the one used here: row 800's
// material survey MEASURES all five materials and REQUIREs the table to name the
// winner ("That is a REQUIRE below, not a comment"). So the seven candidate sets
// are measured by "Seraphis_EffectsTable_IsTheWorstCase" below on EVERY [.perf]
// pass, against a real SpectralDelay driven with the rest of this table's own
// effects values, and the case REQUIREs the transcribed value to be within
// kFxWorstEndTolerance of the costliest candidate. The per-candidate ns/chunk
// figures it prints ARE this banner's dataset; they are deliberately not frozen
// into a comment here, because a wall-clock figure copied into a comment is
// exactly the placeholder this file's BASELINE STATUS section refuses (a
// placeholder must not be able to pass or fail anything, and evidence must).
//
// WHAT THE MEASUREMENT IS EXPECTED TO SHOW, so a surprise is legible rather than
// mysterious - each is a mechanism read out of spectral_delay.h this session, and
// each is subordinate to the number the probe actually reports:
//   1411 = 2000.0 (kMaxDelayMs). readLinear(delayFrames) at ~187 frames back
//          touches a cache line DISTINCT from the write head, where a 0 ms read
//          touches the same one; 513 bins x 4 delay lines makes that the row's
//          only plausible gradient (spectral_delay.h:769-793).
//   1412 = 2000.0 (kMaxSpreadMs). Same mechanism, maximum scatter of the per-bin
//          read positions (calculateBinDelayMs, :611-645).
//   1413 = 2 (CenterOut). The only branch of the switch that costs an extra
//          std::abs and a multiply (:639-641).
//   1415 = +1.0 (kMaxTilt). Uniform tilt keeps every bin's loop gain equal; a
//          full tilt drives one half of the spectrum toward zero, i.e. toward
//          denormal arithmetic, which is the costlier state (:648-659, :807).
//   1418 = OFF, WHICH IS THE REGISTERED DEFAULT -> class 3. Synced mode REPLACES
//          the base delay with dropdownToDelayMs(noteValueIndex_, tempo)
//          (:322-337), whose reachable maximum at index 9 is 1/8T = 166.7 ms at
//          120 BPM - i.e. ~15 frames back, well inside the write head's own
//          cache line, and therefore CHEAPER than row 1411's 2000 ms. Turning
//          sync on would silently make the row 1411 pick unreachable.
//   1419 = 9 ("1/8T"). Inert under 1418 = off, so the ten candidates are
//          expected to TIE; the longest reachable period is transcribed so the
//          row is not left sitting on its registered default (7) by accident.
//   1430 = OFF, WHICH IS THE REGISTERED DEFAULT -> class 3. Freeze SKIPS the four
//          per-bin delay-line writes (:816-824) and pays only the crossfade
//          blend over a small, cache-resident frozen spectrum (:833-859); the
//          writes it skips are the write-allocate traffic that dominates.
//
// IF THE PROBE DISAGREES, THE FIX IS MECHANICAL AND IT IS THE TABLE THAT MOVES,
// NEVER THE TOLERANCE AND NEVER THE 25 % GATE: transcribe the costlier candidate
// into the row above, and - if that candidate IS the row's registered default
// (effects_params.h:104-119) - reclassify the row to RowClass::CoincidesWithDefault
// and move the two counts in the static_asserts below (they are written as
// 10 + 2 and 107 - 8 - 5 - (10 + 2) so the arithmetic of that move is visible).
//
// MEASUREMENT PROTOCOL for the SC-014 figure itself (spec SC-013/SC-014, the
// SINGLE protocol every CPU criterion in that spec is measured under, and the
// same one the cold dataset above was taken under): fresh boot, IDLE machine,
// SEVEN consecutive whole-suite runs of `seraphis_tests.exe "[.perf]"`, each
// figure a best-of-16, the WORST of the seven reported. A breach on an ordinary
// dev or CI machine is not a failure of the criterion - re-measuring under this
// protocol is the first response, exactly as the T029 dataset above established.

// PHASE 10 / SC-014 - TWO FINDINGS RECORDED 2026-08-03, NEITHER OF THEM A
// LICENCE TO TOUCH THE GATE BELOW.
//
// FINDING 1 - WHAT THIS ARM'S TIMED REGION ACTUALLY CONTAINS. The `run` lambda
// below times exactly three calls: SeraphisEngine::processStereoBlock,
// AetherReverb::processStereoBlock and SeraphisEngine::processOutputStage.
// `ChainSubject` (:1813-1819) holds ONLY `engine`, `reverb`, `macros`, `aether`
// and `slots` - there is NO SpectralDelay, NO MidSideProcessor and NO
// BrownianDrift in the subject, and this TU names SpectralDelay only inside
// FxProbe (:1995), which belongs to the SEPARATE table-gating case at the end of
// this file. C-1 STEPS 4 AND 5 - the whole Phase 10 effects stage - ARE
// THEREFORE NOT IN THIS ARM'S MEASURED PATH. The 16 effects rows added to
// kNonDefaultTable are routed through tableVoiceParams() / the macro bases / the
// aether params / applyTableEngValues(), none of which reaches an effects
// component, so on THIS subject they are inert.
//
// That is what T025 asked for - "grow the table to 107 rows and re-run the SC-009
// arm" (tasks.md:1442-1480), and the note at the table-gating case below records
// the same choice ("its subject stays exactly the Phase 9 hand-built pair the
// plan pins"). But SC-014's own text is that the 25 % gate "still passes with the
// effects section ACTIVE", and SC-013's budget derivation composes the two
// figures (20.91 % + 2.5 % = 23.41 %, spec.md:1530-1535). A subject with no
// effects component in it cannot observe either. **SC-014 is therefore
// UNVERIFIED as encoded, on any machine, and this is a spec-vs-plan conflict for
// the phase owner to rule on - not something to patch by widening a gate.** The
// two admissible remedies are: put steps 4 and 5 into this arm's timed region
// (which means giving ChainSubject the send accumulator the processor has), or
// rule that SC-014 is satisfied by ARITHMETIC composition with SC-013's
// separately-measured stage figure and say so in the spec.
//
// FINDING 2 - THE MEASURED DATASET. **SUPERSEDED HOT DATASET FIRST, so the
// history is not lost:** an earlier seven-run attempt on 2026-08-03 was taken on
// a LOADED workstation and read 3 917 050 / 3 892 380 / 4 140 080 / 5 537 210 /
// 4 271 700 / 4 810 130 / 3 932 730 ns (36.72-51.91 %), all seven breaching
// kFullPolyCeilingNs. That host was calibrated, not guessed: SC-008 arm 1 - the
// most stable estimator in this file - read 113.35-116.35 ns across those seven
// runs against the 2026-08-02 fresh-boot worst of 82.40 ns (:157), a
// reproducible 1.38x-1.41x inflation. The conclusion recorded at the time was
// that the host could not carry the criterion. That was correct, and it is why
// the ceiling was never touched.
//
// THE DATASET THAT STANDS - 2026-08-03, seven consecutive runs of
// `seraphis_tests.exe "[.perf]"` on an IDLE host (no concurrent build, no other
// test process; not claimed to be fresh-boot), all seven EXIT=0, each figure a

// worst of 82.40 (:157), with the whole spread inside the cold spread of
// 73.85-82.40. This host is not inflated relative to the protocol's machine, so

// the SAME seven runs is SC-013's worst-of-seven, 49 790 ns = 0.467 % of one
// core (effects_perf_test.cpp's BASELINE PROVENANCE table), so the ARITHMETIC
// composition SC-013's budget derivation calls for is
//
//   2 366 810 + 49 790 = 2 416 600 ns = 22.66 % of one core,
//   against 2 666 666.7 ns (25 %) - 250 067 ns / 2.34 points of headroom.
//
// That is an UPPER BOUND ACROSS TWO SUBJECTS, not one measurement, and it is
// recorded here as evidence for the phase owner's ruling under FINDING 1 - NOT
// as a substitute for it. Whichever remedy is chosen, the levers stay what they
// always were: the stage's own cost and the shipped defaults. NEVER
// kFullPolyCeilingNs, and never kBaselineFullPolyNs, which :454-455 records is

// =============================================================================
// PHASE 11 / SC-009 (specs/seraphis-phase11-ui, task T023) - THE "GATE-OPEN
// RE-RUN" OF THIS ARM, AND WHAT IT CAN AND CANNOT BE
// =============================================================================
// Phase 11's SC-009 names this case as one of its two tests: "a re-run of
// Seraphis_FullPoly_CpuBudget_WithFullSurface with the gate open"
// (specs/seraphis-phase11-ui/spec.md:1362-1370). THE GATE IS NOT AN OPERATION
// THIS SUBJECT ADMITS, and saying so is the honest result rather than a dodge:
//
//   * the "gate" is Phase 11's C-2 clause 6 producer gate, a member of
//     Seraphis::Processor read by publishCloudFrame() (processor.cpp:3986), and
//     opened through Processor::setCloudFrameGateForTest / a C-5 kind-0
//     EditMessage;
//   * FINDING 1 above records what this arm's timed region actually contains:
//     three calls on a hand-built engine/reverb pair. There is NO Processor in
//     it, so there is no gate to open and no publishCloudFrame() to run. The
//     figure below is INVARIANT to the gate BY CONSTRUCTION, and re-running it
//     "with the gate open" produces the same number for the same reason a
//     compiler flag with no code to apply to produces the same binary.
//
// SO WHERE IS THE GATE-OPEN NUMBER? It is a WHOLE-process() figure, and it is
// measured in tests/integration/ui_perf_test.cpp:
//     Seraphis_CloudFrame_CpuBudget                 SC-009(a) gate OPEN
//                                                   SC-009(b) the snapshot stage alone
//     Seraphis_CloudFrame_CostsNothingWhenClosed    SC-010(a)(b) gate CLOSED
//     Seraphis_PartialOverrides_RepushWorstCase     SC-014 arm 7
//     Seraphis_EditGestureInFlight_FitsTheBudget    SC-031
// All four are "[.perf]", run in the SAME `seraphis_tests.exe "[.perf]"` pass as
// this case, and all four gate against kFullPolyCeilingNs / the pinned baseline
// as copied constants pinned by static_assert - so this file's numbers are read
// by them and never edited by them.
//
// WHAT PHASE 11 CHANGED HERE: NOTHING BUT THIS COMMENT AND THE WARN ROW THE CASE
// NOW PRINTS. kFullPolyCeilingNs (:392), kRegressionFactor (:395) and
// kBaselineFullPolyNs (:472) are byte-identical to what Phase 10 left them, and
// T023's file list forbids touching them. If Phase 11's whole-process() arms
// breach their ceilings, the remedies are the ones ui_perf_test.cpp's banners
// enumerate - a cheaper producer, a cheaper fan-out, a narrower
// spectralRetryMask_ - and NOT a constant in this file.
