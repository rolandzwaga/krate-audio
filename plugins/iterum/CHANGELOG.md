# Changelog

All notable changes to Iterum will be documented in this file.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/),
and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## [0.12.0] - 2026-01-16

### Added

- **Wavefold Distortion for Digital Delay**
  - New wavefold processing stage in Digital Delay signal chain
  - Wavefold Amount parameter (0-100%): 0% bypasses, 1-100% maps to fold intensity [0.1, 10.0]
  - Wavefold Type selector: Simple, Serge, Buchla259, Lockhart models
  - Wavefold Symmetry parameter (-100% to +100%): introduces even harmonics at extremes
  - Applied post-feedback network, pre-anti-alias filter for maximum harmonic content
  - UI controls: slider for amount, segment button for type, knob for symmetry

### Fixed

- **Wavefold Model Switching Clicks**
  - Fixed audible clicks when changing wavefold type during playback
  - Corrected Lockhart algorithm DC offset (0.514 → 0) for consistent zero-crossing
  - Improved crossfade state management: primary wavefolder state now preserved during transitions
  - Extended crossfade duration from 10ms to 100ms for smoother transitions
  - DC blocker continuity maintained via state copying before model change

### Changed

- **Rename Torqueo to Disrumpo**
  - Renamed internal distortion component from Torqueo to Disrumpo

---

## [0.11.0] - 2026-01-15

### Added

- **Pitch-Synchronized Low-Latency Pitch Shifting (PitchSync Mode)**
  - New `PitchMode::PitchSync` option for pitch shifting with ~5-10ms latency (vs ~46ms for Granular)
  - Autocorrelation-based `PitchDetector` primitive detects fundamental frequency in real-time
  - `PitchSyncGranularShifter` adapts grain size to 2x detected pitch period
  - Falls back to short fixed grains (~10ms) for unpitched/noisy content
  - Ideal for shimmer effects where feedback is already highly tonal

- **Route-Based Crossfading in FlexibleFeedbackNetwork**
  - Equal-power crossfade between bypass and processed feedback paths
  - Avoids comb filtering artifacts from latency mismatch when blending signals
  - At extremes (0% or 100%), uses direct path to preserve correct feedback loop timing

- **Required Diffusion for Shimmer Effects**
  - Shimmer delay now enforces 100% diffusion when shimmer mix > 1%
  - Commercial shimmer effects always use diffusion to mask granular pitch shift artifacts
  - This is why professional shimmer effects sound smooth at all mix levels

### Changed

- **Shimmer Delay Default Pitch Mode**
  - Changed default from `Granular` (~46ms latency) to `PitchSync` (~5-10ms latency)
  - Improves shimmer response time and reduces latency in feedback path

### Fixed

- **Shimmer Mix Unit Mismatch**
  - Fixed shimmer mix parameter expecting 0-1 range but receiving 0-100%
  - Processor now correctly converts percentage to normalized value

---

## [0.10.0] - 2026-01-05

### Added

- **Custom Tap Pattern Editor (Spec 046)**
  - Visual editor for creating custom MultiTap delay patterns
  - Drag tap bars horizontally to adjust timing (0-100% of delay time)
  - Drag tap handles vertically to adjust level (0-100%)
  - Grid snapping with 22 divisions (Off + all 21 note values including triplets and dotted)
  - Shift+drag constrains to horizontal or vertical axis
  - Double-click resets tap to default position
  - Escape cancels drag and restores pre-drag values
  - Ruler at bottom shows grid divisions based on snap setting
  - Pattern persists across editor open/close and plugin reload
  - Editor automatically shows when "Custom" timing pattern is selected

- **Simplified MultiTap UI**
  - Removed TimeMode, BaseTime, and Internal Tempo controls
  - Rhythmic patterns (indices 0-13) use host tempo directly
  - Mathematical patterns (indices 14-19) use Note Value dropdown with host tempo

### Fixed

- **TapPatternEditor Initialization Order**
  - Fixed custom pattern not displaying correctly when reopening plugin window
  - Tap count now set before loading tap values to prevent defaults overwriting saved data

- **Preset Generator MultiTap Format**
  - Fixed MultiTapPreset struct to match actual save format
  - Added missing fields: noteModifier, customTimeRatios[16], customLevels[16], snapDivision
  - Removed obsolete fields: timeMode, baseTime, tempo
  - Regenerated all 110 factory presets with correct format

- **TapPatternEditor Tap Count Reactivity**
  - Tap count changes now immediately update the editor display
  - New taps initialize with snapped positions based on current grid setting

### Changed

- **Snap Dropdown Expanded**
  - Changed from 6 options (Off, Quarter, Eighth, Sixteenth, ThirtySecond, Triplet) to 22 options
  - Now includes all note values: 1/64T through 1/1D (triplets and dotted variants)
  - Default changed from Quarter (index 1) to 1/4 (index 14) to match new ordering

---

## [0.9.6] - 2026-01-04

### Fixed

- **Editor Close Crash (PresetBrowserView Use-After-Free)**
  - Fixed host crash when closing plugin window after opening preset browser
  - Root cause: `PresetBrowserView::~PresetBrowserView()` called `unregisterTextEditListener()` on already-freed child view
  - VSTGUI's `CViewContainer` destroys child views via `beforeDelete()` → `removeAll()` BEFORE parent destructor runs
  - Solution: Removed the listener unregistration call (child views are already gone by destructor time)
  - Diagnosed using AddressSanitizer (ASan) build

### Added

- **VST-GUIDE.md: VSTGUI CViewContainer Child Destruction Order**
  - Documented VSTGUI's destruction order where child views are destroyed before parent destructor
  - Added quick reference table for what actions are safe/unsafe in CViewContainer destructors

---

## [0.9.5] - 2026-01-04

### Fixed

- **Editor Close Crash (VisibilityController Use-After-Free)**
  - Fixed host crash when closing plugin window quickly after opening
  - Root cause: `deferUpdate()` scheduled updates that fired after controller destruction
  - Added atomic `isActive_` guard to VisibilityController checked before accessing any member
  - Implemented 3-phase shutdown in `willClose()`: deactivate → clear editor → destroy
  - Added regression tests documenting the SafeVisibilityController pattern

- **MultiTap Morph Time Parameter Non-Functional**
  - Fixed Morph Time slider having no effect when changing patterns
  - Root cause: Processor called `loadTimingPattern()` (immediate) instead of `morphToPattern()`
  - Now tracks previous pattern and uses `morphToPattern()` for smooth transitions
  - Morph Time (50-2000ms) controls how smoothly tap times transition between patterns

### Added

- **MultiTap Visibility Controls**
  - BaseTime and Internal Tempo controls now hide in Synced mode (host provides tempo)
  - NoteValue control now shows in Synced mode
  - Added 27 test cases for MultiTap visibility logic

- **AddressSanitizer (ASan) Build Support**
  - Added `ENABLE_ASAN` CMake option for detecting memory errors at runtime
  - Supports MSVC (`/fsanitize=address`) and Clang/GCC (`-fsanitize=address`)
  - Documented usage in CLAUDE.md

---

## [0.1.2] - 2025-12-29

### Added

- **Conditional Visibility for Delay Time Controls**
  - Delay time knobs now automatically hide when time mode is set to "Synced"
  - In synced mode, only note values control delay time, so the time knob is hidden to reduce UI clutter
  - Applies to both Digital Delay and PingPong Delay modes
  - Thread-safe implementation using VST3's IDependent mechanism
  - Updates run on UI thread at 30Hz via UpdateHandler
  - View-switch-safe: Uses dynamic tag-based control lookup instead of cached pointers
  - Survives mode switching between Digital ↔ PingPong without losing functionality

### Changed

- **Default Time Mode**: Digital and PingPong delays now default to "Synced" instead of "Free"
  - Tempo-synced delays are more common in modern production
  - Users can still switch to "Free" mode for millisecond-based timing
  - Delay time controls are hidden by default since synced mode ignores them

### Fixed

- **Thread Safety**: Visibility updates no longer cause crashes when triggered by automation or state loading
  - Previously called `setVisible()` directly from parameter callbacks (can be called from any thread)
  - Now uses IDependent pattern to defer updates to UI thread
- **View-Switch Safety**: Visibility updates continue working after switching between Digital and PingPong modes
  - UIViewSwitchContainer destroys/recreates controls when switching templates
  - Fixed by using dynamic tag-based lookup instead of caching control pointers
  - Added regression test documenting the dangling reference bug

---

## [0.1.1] - 2025-12-28

### Fixed

- **TapeDelay Dry/Wet Mix Bug**: The mix parameter now works correctly
  - Bug: Dry signal was read AFTER TapManager overwrote buffers with wet signal
  - Result: mix=0% or mix=50% still produced 100% wet output
  - Fix: Save dry signal to stack-allocated temp buffers BEFORE processing
  - Real-time safe: Uses `constexpr kMaxBlockSize` (4096), no heap allocations
  - Applies to both stereo and mono `process()` methods

### Added

- **Regression Tests for Dry/Wet Mix** (`tests/unit/features/tape_delay_test.cpp`)
  - 7 new tests to prevent reintroduction of the bug:
    - Mix=0 (dry): output equals input exactly
    - Mix=1 (wet): dry signal completely absent
    - Mix=0.5: both dry and wet present with correct proportions
    - Impulse produces immediate output (dry path)
    - Wet echo appears at correct delay time
    - Mono dry signal passthrough
    - Mono 50% mix produces correct amplitude

---

## [0.1.0] - 2025-12-28

  - Now: Store dB directly in params, pass to delay without conversion
  - Affected modes: Tape, BBD, Digital, PingPong, MultiTap

- **FeedbackNetwork & FlexibleFeedbackNetwork**: Integrated CrossfadingDelayLine
  - Delay time changes now click-free via automatic crossfading
  - Maintains all existing API, internal implementation upgraded

### Fixed

- DigitalDelay tempo sync now uses proper Layer 0 note value utilities
- Dropdown parameters use explicit mappings instead of assumption-based casts

### Technical Details

- **Test Coverage**: 1,419 DSP test cases + 8 VST test cases, all passing
- **Architecture**: 5-layer DSP system (Layers 0-4) with clean dependency hierarchy
- **Real-Time Safe**: All audio processing is `noexcept`, allocation-free
- **Cross-Platform**: Builds on Windows (MSVC), macOS (Clang), Linux (GCC)

### Breaking Changes

  - NaN handling: `dbToGain(NaN)` returns 0.0f, `gainToDb(NaN)` returns -144 dB

- **Custom constexpr math implementations** (MSVC compatibility)
  - Taylor series `constexprExp()` and `constexprLn()` functions
  - Required because MSVC lacks constexpr `std::pow`/`std::log10`

- **Comprehensive test suite** (146 assertions across 24 test cases)
  - Unit tests for all dB conversion functions
  - Constexpr compile-time evaluation tests
  - Edge case coverage (NaN, infinity, silence)

- **Project infrastructure**
  - Layered DSP architecture (Layer 0-4 hierarchy)
  - Test-first development workflow (Constitution Principle XII)
  - Catch2 testing framework integration

### Technical Details

- **Silence floor**: -144 dB (24-bit dynamic range: 6.02 dB/bit * 24 = ~144 dB)
- **Formulas**:
  - `dbToGain`: gain = 10^(dB/20)
  - `gainToDb`: dB = 20 * log10(gain), clamped to -144 dB floor
- **Namespace**: `Iterum::DSP` (Layer 0 core utilities)

### Usage

```cpp
#include "dsp/core/db_utils.h"

// Runtime conversion
float gain = Iterum::DSP::dbToGain(-6.0f);    // ~0.5
float dB   = Iterum::DSP::gainToDb(0.5f);     // ~-6 dB

// Compile-time lookup tables
constexpr std::array<float, 3> gains = {
    Iterum::DSP::dbToGain(-20.0f),  // 0.1
    Iterum::DSP::dbToGain(0.0f),    // 1.0
    Iterum::DSP::dbToGain(20.0f)    // 10.0
};
```
